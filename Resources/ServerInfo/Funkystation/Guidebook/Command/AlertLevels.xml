  # Alert Levels and You!

  [bold]What is an alert level?[/bold]

  Alert levels are a way to quickly alert crew of any possible threats that may be present on the station.

  Alert levels also determine which procedures to follow, including security. On certain alert levels, security may be granted more leniency to deal with threats and unruly crew.

  Failure to abide by the regulations put on by these alert levels may result in contract termination.

  The following are all possible alert levels:
