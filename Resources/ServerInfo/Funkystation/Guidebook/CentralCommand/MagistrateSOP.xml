# Magistrate SOP

[bold]1.[/bold] The Magistrate holds the ultimate punitive authority on station. When exercising this authority the Magistrate is directly exercising the will of [color=#009100]Central Command[/color];

[bold]2.[/bold] The Magistrate may overrule anyone, save [color=#009100]Central Command[/color], in all matters concerning Space Law.

[bold]3.[/bold] The Magistrate is to ensure that station resources are not wasted on trials that are frivolous in nature or whos outcomes are a forgone conclusion. Magistrates have authority to summarily sentence and pass judgement in such cases, but should ensure due diligence has been enforced in regards to the collection of evidence;

[bold]4.[/bold] The Magistrate is [bold]not[/bold] above [textlink="Space Law" link="SpaceLaw"] and may not make rulings in matters concerning their own potential misconduct;

[bold]5.[/bold] The Magistrate is to ensure that the [color=#009100]NanoTrasen Representative[/color] and [color=#009100]Internal Affairs Agents[/color] under their command are responding appropriately to matters of and misconduct regarding Standard Operating Procedure.

[bold]6.[/bold] The Magistrate, outside the context of a trial, should only concern themselves with crimes that either have fuzzy evidence, require careful deliberation of circumstances, or have been horrendously mishandled;

[bold]7.[/bold] The Magistrate may administer class 1, 2, and 3 penalties for misconduct concerning the misinterpretation of [textlink="Space Law" link="SpaceLaw"]. They should consult with the [color=#009100]NanoTrasen Representative[/color] before administering penalties for misconduct concerning standard operating procedure, but have authority to administer up to class 3 penalties for those breaches as well.

[bold]8.[/bold] The Magistrate is permitted to carry their flash;

## Magistrate OOC Rules

[bold]1.[/bold] You are not a mega Captain. You are really only on station as an advisor, and should generally only exersize your authority in regard to matters other than space law in extreme circumstances, or obvious cases of wrongdoing.

[bold]2.[/bold] You are a non combatant advisor, and should not be participating in combat except in the case of self defense.

[bold]3.[/bold] You have a LOT of power as the Magistrate. Abuse of this trust will result in a permanent, non appealable role ban from CC roles. Your job is to make the round more fun through interesting role play, not just be an authoritarian power tripper.
