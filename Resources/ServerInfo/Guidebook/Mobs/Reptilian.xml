  Evolved from snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and all sorts of other reptiles, Reptilians are a hardy alien species.

  ## Claws and Tails

  Reptilian claws are sharp, and deal [color=orange]Slashing[/color] damage. Additionally, Reptilians' tails enable
  them to drag objects and people with both of their hands free.

  ## Diet

  Reptilians can only eat fruits, meat, and certain special foods like chocolate. They can, however, eat raw meat,
  paper, crayons, and drink blood without biological consequences.
  Your fellow crew might look at you differently, though...

  ## Damage

  Reptilians are more comfortable in higher temperatures than other species, but tend to get cold quicker as a result,
  and suffer 30% more [color=cornflowerblue]Cold[/color] damage.

  ## Reptilian Naming Conventions

  Reptilians typically have hyphenated two to four syllable names favouring guttural consonants while avoiding soft sounds.

  [bullet] Neeus-Hixeeh

  [bullet] Wud-Geel

  [bullet] Deroh-Haj

  Some are known to have names that follow a pattern of Nouns-The-Verb, typically self-assigned or given by family.

  [bullet] Cleans-The-Floor

  [bullet] Fights-The-Battles

  [bullet] Treats-The-Injuries
