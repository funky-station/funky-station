  # Rule 12 - Play Antagonists Responsibly
  The goal of an antagonist is above all else to create conflict (fun!!) within the station.

  Generally, you should be following your objectives and avoiding just racking up a kill count as an undercover agent. Murderboning is only fun for the person doing it. Certain antagonists (Nuclear Operatives, space dragons) are exempt from this.

  Team Antagonists (Nukeops, Revheads, etc.) should ahelp before leaving so their place can be filled.

  Lone Antagonists (Traitors, Heretics, Changelings) are not required to work together or with other Team/Lone Antagonists. Team Antagonists (nukeops, zombies, revolutionaries) must work together at all times.

  Mass station destruction (singuloosing, maxcaps, etc.) are reserved for antagonists who end the round by default, such as Nuclear Operatives and should not be done as a regular Traitor or other antagonist without first ahelping.

  Pre-turned Initial Infected are permitted to take any actions that increase the chances of taking over the station and may aid in spreading the zombie virus. Actions that cause overt damage to the station and crew are not allowed if they do not aid in the spread of the virus post-turn. (Loosing of the main engines, Atmos-flooding, etc.)

  Post-turned Zombies are not allowed under any circumstance to break vital station components such as power sources, electronics, distribution pipes, or wiring.
