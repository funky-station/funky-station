# Configuration for salvage magnet ruin generation.
# This controls flood-fill parameters and damage simulation.

- type: salvageMagnetRuinConfig
  id: Default
  floodFillPoints: 20 #if you increase this, also increase the ruinSpawnDistance, otherwise the ruins will spawn ontop of the magnet
  ruinSpawnDistance: 80  # Distance in tiles from magnet where ruins spawn
  wallDestroyChance: 0.15 #chance of a wall being destroyed and not spawned
  windowDamageChance: 0.05 #chance of a window being damaged and not spawned
  floorToLatticeChance: 0.05 #chance of a floor tile being replaced with lattice, makes it look more damaged
  # Path costs for flood-fill algorithm (higher = more expensive to traverse)
  # the way floodfill works, it costs this much to traverse each tile
  wallCost: 20
  directionalWindowCost: 10
  reinforcedWindowCost: 10
  regularWindowCost: 4
  directionalGlassCost: 8
  reinforcedGlassCost: 12
  regularGlassCost: 8
  grilleCost: 4
  defaultTileCost: 1
  spaceCost: 9999  # Space tiles (not in map) - very high cost makes them impassable
  floodFillStages: 5  # Number of flood-fill stages to create irregular branching shapes. It does the flood fill this many times on the edges to construct the ruin.
