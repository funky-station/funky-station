  Lümala ([italic]LOO-ma-la[/italic], singular also lümala) are fuzzy, bewinged insect-humanoid aliens that share ancestry with the common moth.

  ## Diet

  Lümala can eat cotton, fabrics and clothing, but virtually none of the food that others would consider "edible".

  ## Insectoid Physiology

  Covered in hair-like fuzz, lümala tend to prefer a lower temperature range than humans. Furthermore, their blood
  cannot be metabolized from Iron. Their wings give them better acceleration if there is no gravity on the station, but
  they still can't move without equipment when floating out in space.

  ## Damage

  Lümala take 30% less [color=cornflowerblue]Cold[/color] damage but 20% more [color=red]Heat[/color] damage, and catch
  on fire more easily.

  ## Lümala Naming Conventions

  Lümala typically have latin and light related names.
