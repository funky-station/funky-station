  # Rule 8 - Have an Appropriate Name

  If a name could reasonably appear on a driver's license in the year 3000, it's probably alright.

  Humans, dwarves, felinids, and harpies must have both a first and last name. Other species are exempt from this rule if you can reasonably say 'yeah, that's alien'.

  Names may contain prefixes, suffixes, and one nickname if reasonable.

  Admins may ask you to change your name if it's low-effort / overdone (John Central Command)

  No flat-out copying characters from popular media. A reference is okay, but give it enough variance to not be a straight up copycat character.
