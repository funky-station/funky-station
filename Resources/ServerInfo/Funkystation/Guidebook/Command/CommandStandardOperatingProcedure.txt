  [bold]2.[/bold] The Captain is not permitted to take items from the Armory under normal circumstances, unless authorized by the Head of Security. In addition, the Captain may not requisition weaponry for themselves from Cargo and/or Science, unless there's an immediate threat to station and/or crew;

The Acting Head of Staff must be a member of the Department vetted prior to shift start by central command, not a promoted member from another department;

  [bold]4.[/bold] The Captain is not to leave the Station unless given specific permission by Central Command, or it happens to be the end of the shift. To do so is to be considered abandoning their posts and is grounds for termination;

  [bold]6.[/bold] The Captain is to attempt to resolve every issue that arises in Command locally before contacting Central Command;

  [bold]8.[/bold] The Captain may not fire any Head of Staff without reasonable justification (ie, incompetency, criminal activity, or otherwise any action that endangers/compromises the station and/or crew). The Captain may not fire any Central Command staff (NanoTrasen Representative, etc) without permission from Central Command. If such crewmembers are blatantly acting against the well-being and safety of the crew and station, the captain has the authority to confine them to their quarters pending a response from Central Command.

  [bold]1.[/bold] The Head of Personnel may not transfer any personnel to another Department without authorization from the relevant Head of Staff. If no Head of Staff is available, the Head of Personnel may make a judgment call. This does not apply to Security, which always requires authorization from the Head of Security, or Genetics, which requires both Chief Medical Officer and Research Director approval. If there is no Head of Security active, no transfers are allowed to Security without authorization from the Captain;

  [bold]2.[/bold] The Head of Personnel may not give any personnel increased access without authorization from the relevant Head of Staff. This includes the Head of Personnel.

  [bold]6.[/bold] The Head of Personnel is free to utilize paperwork at their discretion. However, during major station emergencies, expediency should take precedence over bureaucracy;

  [bold]7.[/bold] The Head of Personnel may not leave their office unmanned if there are personnel waiting in line. Failure to respond to personnel with a legitimate request within ten (10) minutes, either via radio or in person is to be considered a breach of Standard Operating Procedure;

  [bold]8.[/bold] The Head of Personnel is not permitted to perform Security duty. The Head of Personnel is permitted to carry a Disabler for self-defense only.

  # Internal Affairs Agent SOP

  [bold]1.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents are to ensure that Standard Operating Procedure is being properly followed, and to contact the relevant Head of Staff when it is not;

  [bold]2.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents are to follow the following chain of escalation should their reports be ignored, or they feel a judgement is incorrect: Relevant Head of Staff -> Captain -> NanoTrasen Representative -> Magistrate -> Central Command;

  [bold]3.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents are only to concern themselves with matters of space law if there is no Magistrate and no NanoTrasen Representative aboard the station, or if the Magistrate or NanoTrasen Representative give them orders to do so, or if Central Command contacts them directly and requests that they do so;

  [bold]4.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents must be granted permission from the presiding Judge (i.e. the Magistrate or Nanotrasen Representative) to serve as legal representation for personnel in any court hearing. Internal Affairs Agents may only serve as legal representation for personnel if another Internal Affairs Agent is capable of assuming the role of prosecution, and if no Lawyer is available. Internal Affairs Agents must also request permission from any potential client before serving as their legal representative, as said client may choose to either represent themselves, or request someone else;

  [bold]5.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents may administer class 1 penalties for misconduct concerning Standard Operating Procedure after first recieving approval from the NanoTrasen Representative or Magistrate. They may only administer penalties for misconduct concerning misinterpretation of space law in the absense of a NanoTrasen Representative and Magistrate, and may never administer class 2 or 3 penalties even when serving as the only Central Command staff on station.

  [bold]6.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents are permitted to carry their flash and their administrative sunglasses;

  # Nanotrasen Representative SOP

  [bold]1.[/bold] The NanoTrasen Representative is to ensure that every Department is following Standard Operating Procedure, up to and including the respective Head of Staff. If a Head of Staff is not available for a Department, the NanoTrasen Representative must ensure that the Captain appoints an Acting Head of Staff for said Department;

  [bold]2.[/bold] The NanoTrasen Representative must attempt to resolve any breach of Standard Operating Procedure locally before contacting Central Command.

  [bold]3.[/bold] In the absense of a Magistrate, the NanoTrasen Representative must ensure that space law is being adequately followed and enforced.

  [bold]4.[/bold] The NanoTrasen Representative may administer class 1 and 2 penalties for misconduct concerning Standard Operating Procedure. They may only administer penalties for misconduct concerning misinterpretation of space law in the absense of a Magistrate, and may never administer class 3 penalties even when there is no acting Magistrate;

  [bold]5.[/bold] The NanoTrasen Representative must follow the directions of the Magistrate and defer to their judgement in matters not concerning standard operating procedure, but should advocate their stance firmly in the case of disagreements, and escalate to Central Command directly if they feel there has been wrongdoing;

  [bold]6.[/bold] The NanoTrasen Representative is permitted to carry their flash and a blade-cane, or a stun baton if the blade-cane is lost;

  # Magistrate SOP

  [bold]1.[/bold] The Magistrate holds the ultimate punitive authority on station. When exercising this authority the Magistrate is directly exercising the will of Central Command;

  [bold]2.[/bold] The Magistrate may overrule anyone, save Central Command, in all matters concerning Space Law.

  [bold]3.[/bold] The Magistrate is to ensure that station resources are not wasted on trials that are frivolous in nature or whos outcomes are a forgone conclusion. Magistrates have authority to summarily sentence and pass judgement in such cases, but should ensure due diligence has been enforced in regards to the collection of evidence;

  [bold]4.[/bold] The Magistrate is not above Space Law and may not make rulings in matters concerning their own potential misconduct;

  [bold]5.[/bold] The Magistrate is to ensure that the NanoTrasen Representative and internal affairs agents under their command are responding appropriately to matters of and misconduct regarding Standard Operating Procedure.

  [bold]6.[/bold] The Magistrate, outside the context of a trial, should only concern themselves with crimes that either have fuzzy evidence, require careful deliberation of circumstances, or have been horrendously mishandled;

  [bold]7.[/bold] The Magistrate may administer class 1, 2, and 3 penalties for misconduct concerning the misinterpretation of space law. They should consult with the NanoTrasen Representative before administering penalties for misconduct concerning standard operating procedure, but have authority to administer up to class 3 penalties for those breaches as well.

  [bold]8.[/bold] The Magistrate is permitted to carry their flash;

  # Central Command Staff Punitive Measures
  [italic]Punitive measures are administered in cases of misconduct that are NOT direct violations of Space Law - including violations of SOP.[/italic]

  [bold]Class 1.[/bold] Central Command staff may confiscate any NanoTrasen equipment in the posession of crew or command as a penalty for misconduct;

  [bold]Class 2.[/bold] Central Command staff may impose a demotion upon crew or command as a penalty for egregious misconduct;

  [bold]Class 3.[/bold] Central Command staff may order the execution of staff in the case of egregious misconduct. This should be as a last resort, after other punishments have failed to lead to reform.

  ## Confiscation Procedure

  [bold]1.[/bold] Items confiscated by an Internal Affairs Agent or by the NTR are to be stored in the locker of either the NTR, or the locker of the magistrate. Items confiscated by the Magistrate outside of the confines of a court proceeding are to be stored in the Magistrates locker.

  [bold]2.[/bold] The Magistrate or presiding judge has authority to award items confiscated as the result of court proceedings to the victorious party, at their discretion. Such decisions must be notarized, and a copy must be stored in the locker of the Magistrate or NTR.

  [bold]3.[/bold] In court cases where a plaintiff shows renewed compliance with procedure or policy, and the presiding judge rules in their favor, any confiscated items are to be returned to the individual and they are to be reinstated to their post.

  # If you need to deviate,

  [bold]Document document document![/bold]
  After action reports, calling CentCom on the fabled red phone, or even praying will be heard by CentCom and your actions may be excused if they were determined to be in the best interest of NanoTrasen.
