  # Harpy

  Harpies are an avian human mutation, sprouting feathered wings and ruffled tails.

  ## Claws And Beaks

  Harpies' talons and beaks are pointed and sharp, and their unarmed attacks deal [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage. Unfortunately,
  their digitigrade legs and sharp talons mean they cannot comfortably wear any footwear.

  ## Singing Voice

  Harpies are capable of singing out a tune on the spot with their voice, allowing for you to play music with any
  instrument wherever you are, as long as you aren't muffled!

  ## Natural Flight

  Harpies can fly with their wings to increase their movement speed dramatically, at the cost of heavy stamina drain
  and a temporary inability to use their hands. Their wings also give them better acceleration if there is no gravity
  on the station, but they still can't move without equipment when floating out in space. Finally, Harpies cannot
  set off landmines or cut their feet on shards of glass!

  ## Sensitive Lungs
  Harpies have sensitive lungs. This causes them to breathe [color=#1e90ff]3 times faster[/color] than other species
  and gasp when there is 0.2 combined mols of either miasma or CO2 in the air.

  ## Damage
  Harpies take 15% more [color=#ec3a3a]Blunt[/color], [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] and [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage due to
  their hollow bones and avian physiology.
