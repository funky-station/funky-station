  Felinids are a mutation of humans, sporting their signature ears and tail from your favourite japanese cartoons.

  ## Diet

  Felinids share evolutionary roots with cats, and so they cannot metabolize Theobromine or Allicin. Be careful
  when eating chocolate, onions, or garlic, and avoid coffee and tea! Despite their dietary restrictions, they get
  thirsty 20% faster than other species.

  ## Claws

  Felinids have razor sharp claws, so their unarmed attacks deal [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] and [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage.

  ## Keen Senses

  Felinids take less damage from falling and impacts than other species thanks to their evolutionary roots!

  ## Padded Feet

  Felinids can creep around silently when they're not wearing shoes, but are prone to being stunned quicker and have
  25% less stamina than other species.

  ## Damage

  Felinids take 15% more [color=#ec3a3a]Blunt[/color], [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] and [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage,
  and take 30% more [color=#ec3a3a]Cold[/color] damage than other species.
