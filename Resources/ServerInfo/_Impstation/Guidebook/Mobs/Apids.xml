Apids, or "bee people" as they are sometimes known colloquially, are a unique asset to Nanotrasen's logistics network.

They are a eusocial species, forming "hives" with a high degree of organization and efficiency. One of these hives was purchased recently in a trade deal for research and development purposes, but Apids quickly demonstrated their usefulness in NT's broader workforce - The hive has since taken on an important role in our staffing process, providing short-term, on-demand employees to fill several roles.

## Employment

Apids are transported in vacuum-sealed cryo-stasis pods (available for purchase at your station's Cargo department), where they remain until needed to fill their designated role. [color=#ffa500]Please note that Apids may take some time to awaken from cryo-sleep. Please allow 2-4 business days before contacting Customer Support.[/color]

Purchased Apids are [color=#1e90ff]full Crew Members, and are as such beeholden to Space Law.[/color]

## Physiology
Apids possess uniquely weak limbs, rendering them incapable of maneuvering normally on the ground - however, [color=#1e90ff]their strong wings and ultralight physiology enable them to fly continuously under standard NT gravity.[/color]

This reliance on being airborne does come with significant disadvantages - [color=#ffa500]They are considerably more fragile than other species,[/color] falling into a critical state after only 60 damage, becoming unconscious at 95, and dying after sustating 125 damage. Their fuzzy fur renders them 20% more vulnerable to Heat damage, but 30% less vulnerable to Cold damage.

Apids are uniquely equipped with a stinger on their abdomen, enabling them to defend themselves by dealing small amounts of Shock and Stamina damage. However, [color=#ffa500]the placement of their wings prevents them from wearing backpacks, jetpacks, or suit tanks.[/color]
