  # Station Alert - Red

  <Box>
    [italic]Called by: Anyone with Command-Level Access at a working Communications Console.[/italic]
  </Box>

  [bold]Conditions:[/bold]

  There is a confirmed, hostile threat on-board the station or nearby in space. This threat should pose a recognizable danger to the station and/or crew at large, beyond an isolated range of impact.

  [bold]Security:[/bold]

 Security personnel are to cooperate fully with any Central Command Staff (such as Emergency Response Teams) in order to eliminate the threat to the station.

  [bold]Secure Areas:[/bold]

 Anywhere else requiring command-level access.

  Secure Areas may be left bolted or unbolted at the discretion of Command personnel.

  [bold]General Crew:[/bold]

  All personnel are [bold]required[/bold] to maximize their Suit Sensors. Personnel in violation of this order may be charged with Endangerment.

  Command Personnel may choose to announce that Maintenance is now a secure area. This is to be respected if so, and personnel in violation of this order may be charged with Trespass (not Secure Trespass) and forcibly removed by Security.

  Those with no area/department are to remain inside the Bar, Library, or Dormitories for the duration of Code Red if requested.

  Personnel are to follow the instructions of Security staff, so long as they are within the bounds of Space Law and are not acting against the general well-being of the station and its crew. Failure to do so may lead to their arrest for Failure to Comply.
