# Chef
A fella has gotta eat, and it's the chef's job to make sure folks have something other than junk to munch on.


[textlink="Click here to see a list of food recipes." link="FoodRecipes"]

First and foremost, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the kitchen, and the tools available to you.

## Kitchen Prep:

It's hard to put into words how to work as a chef without feeling like you're being given orders, but here are some basics.

- Check what you have on hand when it comes to ingredients, most kitchens have some Flour, Rice, Eggs, Monkey Cubes, and a few other things to get started with.
- Try your hand at mixing up some dough by putting water and flour together in a beaker. (Use the sinks!)
- Check the Wiki (or Food Recipes) guidebook for things you can make, and put all the listed ingredients into a microwave to cook it into a meal.
- Set up mouse traps. Yes, really. It's easy to see all your hard work disappear if you don't take precautions for mice infestations.

Once you're a bit more experienced and familiar with what you can make, it might be best to put together a few menus, or a "cheat sheet" so you can give a list of ingredients to botany.

## Mixing Dough:
Add Flour and Water together in a beaker. (Use the sink for water!)

## Making Cheese/Tofu/Chèvre:
Adding Milk to a little bit of Universal Enzyme (catalyst) in a beaker can give you various items;
Cow Milk gives you Cheese, Soy Milk makes Tofu, and Goat Milk makes Chèvre.

## Making Butter:
Pouring Milk into a beaker and adding a pinch of salt will give you a stick of butter.
Note: You might need a bit more milk than you expect.

## Getting Plants:
Ask Botany for what you need, without a botanist, you may need to grow more plants yourself.

## Gathering Milk:
Alt-Click on a Cow with a container in your hand. (Beakers, Buckets, Milk Jugs, ect.)
<Box>

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobCow"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="DrinkMilkCarton"/>
</Box>
## How to Butcher:
In most cases, you should be able to use a knife directly on a creature that's dead. It's best to do this in the freezer, as the results are... messy.

Monkeys, however, (and other humanoids), need to be dragged onto a meatspike to be butchered.
