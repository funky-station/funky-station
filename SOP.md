# Standard Procedures
## Hiring/Transfer Policies
* No new hires or transfers are permitted without contacting the relevant Head of Staff. If one is not available, promoting an Acting Head of Staff is recommended. If none is available, the Head of Personnel/Captain are to utilize their best judgment (see Command SOP for any exceptions);
* Promotion to Acting Head of Staff requires authorization by the Captain or Acting Captain;
* The following jobs require permission from Central Command before hiring/transfer is done: Blueshield and the Nanotrasen Representative. The same applies to any functionally identical job with another title;
* All new hires to the Security Department, and Legal Sub-Department, are to be mindshield implanted and fully checked for unauthorized materials or suspicious communications.
## Firing/Demotion Policies
* In the case of a full dismissal, the relevant ID is to be terminated by disabling all access and storing it in a secure location;
* In the case of a demotion, Civilian-level access is recommended. Alternatively, jobs such as Janitor or Clown may also be used;
* No dismissals or demotions are to be performed without authorization from the relevant Head of Staff or Captain. See Chain of Command for how to handle dismissing a member of Command;
* Personnel are to report to the Head of Personnel for dismissal/demotion. Failure to do so will lead to Security detaining them forcefully;
* After a legal dismissal/demotion order is given to the person dismissed/demoted (e.g: by radio), any activity inside the previously assigned Department is to be considered Trespassing/Major Trespassing, and any item kept from said Department is to be considered Petty Theft/Theft. It is, as such, highly recommended that dismissed/demoted personnel willingly turn in all restricted items and cooperate with the process if they wish to avoid being brigged.

## Causes for Demotion and Dismissal
_Refer to the above for dismissal authority. Ultimately, the decision to fire/demote any personnel falls to the relevant Head of Staff or Captain. This is merely a list of reasons to fire someone over._
* Any medium-severe breach of Standard Operating Procedure without proper cause;
* Any medium crime or higher;
* Critical incompetence at a given job;
* Refusal to follow legal and relevant orders by the respective Head of Staff. Legality and relevance of said orders are to be judged by the Captain or Head of Personnel;
* Creation of an abusive and/or unsafe work environment. Personnel constantly berating, insulting, belittling, or otherwise treating their coworkers like dirt, should be immediately disciplined.

## Vote of No Confidence
_A Vote of No Confidence is a method for crew to arrange for demotions of unfit command members. It must have a justified reason, detailed below, against the Head of Staff or Captain in question._
* Votes have to be verified by a 3rd party who will tally the votes and verify the validity of the reason for it. The 3rd party must be the on-station Captain (unless they are the target of the vote), NT Representative or Centcomm if none of the previous are capable of acting as such.
* If the 3rd party dismisses the vote reason, the target of the vote must have their authority respected and not be further harassed about it, doing so may result in a demotion for creating an abusive work environment against them. If the department is understaffed or a tie occurs, the 3rd party may participate in the vote.
* Votes by departamental crew against their Head of Staff must pass with a 2/3 majority in favor of the vote for it to take effect.
* Votes by Heads of Staff against their Captain must pass a simple majority in favor of the vote for it to take effect.
* Justified reasons for a vote include but are not limited to; 'Causes for Demotion and Dismissal' breaches, Absenteeism, critical lack of communication, abuse of authority and incompetence, among others.
* Unjustified reasons for a vote include but are not limited to; Personal gripes, reasonable and legal disciplining or firing of their staff and denial of permission, among others.
* If someone is to be demoted by a vote, Centcomm is to be informed afterwards via fax the details, vote count, reasons alongside other relevant information of the demotion.

If there is no Head of Security active, no transfers are allowed to Security without authorization from the Captain;
2. The Head of Personnel may not give any personnel increased access without authorization from the relevant Head of Staff. This includes the Head of Personnel.

However, all apprehended personnel are to be processed by Security personnel;

# Use of Lethal Force

_EoC: Enemy of the Corporation_

Enemies of the Corporation include but are not limited to: The Syndicate (through secret agents, boarding parties, and brainwashing specialists), Changelings, Heretics, and other intelligent hostile forms of life that seek to cause major damage to the station and or crew.

* **Execution/Imprisonment** - If an Enemy of the Corporation has not committed any capital crimes they are to be placed in Permanent Imprisonment (Permabrig/Solitary/Labor Camp) without exception. Otherwise, Execution is permitted at the discretion of the Captain, with approval from CentComm. Leniency is granted during a Red Alert.
* **Uncontainable EoCs** - Heretics, or any other Enemies of the Corporation that cannot be contained safely in the Brig, are to be executed irrespective of their crimes. Head Revolutionaries are to be executed as soon as they are positively identified. Being a space-proof species does not constitute being impossible to contain.
* **Changelings** - All changelings are to be considered hostile alien lifeforms and a direct threat to all personnel. All changelings are to be killed on sight and immediately cremated. Forensic evidence and/or direct testimony from Mindshielded personnel is necessary to establish proof they are a changeling. Personnel who provide false testimony are to be charged with Murder if the supposed changeling is killed and attempted murder if it is not.
* **Surrendering EoCs** - Enemies of the Corporation that willingly turn themselves into Security of their own accord are to be kept in Permanent Imprisonment so long as they aren't impossible to contain. Defectors and captives are to be transported to Central Command via the Crew Transfer Shuttle; they are to be treated as dangerous enemies, but also protected from retribution and provided for.

Situations that warrant the use of Deadly Force are few and far between. In the vast majority of cases, Security is expected to use non-lethal tools which are generally more effective in defusing situations. It is preferable to capture personnel through non-lethal means unless a situation warrants otherwise. Failure to adhere to this principle will result in discipline, demotion, and even job bans.

There are, however, circumstances where deadly force is permissible:

## Non-EoC’s / Petty Criminals
* Non-EoC’s and Petty Criminals such as thieves, rioters, and former revolutionaries should be revived / deconverted as soon as possible. Do not resuscitate orders cannot be issued for such petty criminals, and if lethal force is used on such criminals, charges against them are recommended to be dropped, as being crit / dead is punishment enough.

## Lethals Authorized - Post-Combat Treatment / Revival Required
* Armed and Dangerous Individuals
* May include people with stun weapons, lethal weapons, etc.
* Multiple Assailants
* Individuals Possessing Explosives
* (Grenades, welding fuel tanks, etc.)
* Revolutionaries
* Armory Trespassers

## Lethals Recommended - Posthumous Revival Potentially Required
* Heretics
* Holoparasite Users
* Hostile Hardsuits
* Non-Crew
* Ash Walkers (ghouls), abominable creatures
* Uncontainable sentient beings

## Lethals Authorized - Kill on Sight
* Ascended Heretics
* Nuclear Operatives
* Perma Escapees (when outside the Permabrig)
* Exogenous Threats
* Bluespace Entities
* Revolutionary Heads
* Abominations
