# Station Engineer SOP

[bold]1.[/bold] Engineers must properly wire Solar Panels and activate the Anti-Matter Engine (AME) if available, and co-ordinate a plan to activate a more powerful engine for long-term station use;

[bold]2.[/bold] Engineers are responsible for maintaining the integrity of all engines aboard the station, even those that are de-activated or inert. Neglecting this duty is grounds for termination should an engine malfunction;

[bold]3.[/bold] Engineers are permitted to construct additional engines (such as additional SM/Tesla/Singularity engines) with approval from the [color=#1b67a5]Chief Engineer[/color];

[bold]4.[/bold] Engineers are permitted to carry out solo reconstruction/rebuilding/personal projects if there is no damage to the station that requires fixing;

[bold]5.[/bold] Engineers must check each active engine at least once per 30 minutes;

[bold]6.[/bold] Engineers must constantly monitor the Supermatter engine if it is online and under emitter fire;

[bold]7.[/bold] Engineers must respond promptly to breaches, regardless of size. Failure to report within fifteen (15) minutes will be considered a breach of Standard Operating Procedure, unless there are no spare Engineers to report All Hazard Zones must be cordoned off with Engineering Tape or Holobarriers, for the safety of crewmembers;

[bold]8.[/bold] Engineers are permitted to hack doors to gain unauthorized access to locations if said locations happen to require [bold]urgent[/bold] repairs;

[bold]9.[/bold] Engineers are to maintain the integrity of the Station's Power Network;

[bold]10.[/bold] Engineers must ensure there is at least one (1) engineering hardsuit available on the station at all times, unless there is an emergency that requires the use of all suits.

[bold]11.[/bold] Engineers are permitted to completely repipe the Atmospherics Piping Setup, provided they do not pump harmful gases into distro;

[bold]12.[/bold] Engineers are [bold]not[/bold] permitted to create volatile or harmful mixes to use outside atmospherics;

[bold]13.[/bold] Engineers are [bold]not[/bold] permitted to take the axe out of its case out-side of a construction zone or if there is an immediate and urgent threat to their life or urgent access to crisis locations is necessary. The axe must be returned to the case afterwards, and the case locked;

[bold]14.[/bold] Engineers are [bold]not[/bold] permitted to tamper with the default values on Air Alarms outside of atmospherics without express permission from CE;

[bold]15.[/bold] Engineers must periodically check on the Central Alarms Computer, in periods of, at most, thirty (30) minutes;

[bold]16.[/bold] Engineers must ensure that distro has a steady supply of the appropriate mix and ensure the station remains breathable.
