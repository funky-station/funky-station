  Rodentia are a race of humanoid beings resembling rodents. Resourceful, evasive, sneaky, but fragile.

  ## Diet

  Rodentia share evolutionary roots with rodents, and so they cannot metabolize Theobromine or Allicin. Be careful
  when eating chocolate, onions, or garlic, and avoid coffee and tea!

  ## Claws

  Rodentia have dull claws, which do a mixture of [color=#ec3a3a]Blunt[/color] and [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] damage.

  ## Rummaging

  Rodentia can rummage in disposal units, potentially finding food or other useful !

  ## Cheek Storage

  Rodentia can store small items in their cheeks. Having items in their mouth makes their speech unintelligible, and
  they will drop all items in their mouth if attacked, stunned, or shoved.

  ## Drawbacks

  Rodentia take 30% more [color=#ec3a3a]Blunt[/color] damage, and 15% more [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] and [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage.
  Rodentia always triggers mousetraps, regardless of whether or not they are wearing shoes.
  Rodentia get hungry 33% faster.
