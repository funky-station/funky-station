  Rodentia are a race of humanoid beings resembling rodents. Resourceful, evasive, sneaky, but fragile.

  ## Diet

  Rodentia share evolutionary roots with rodents, and so they cannot metabolize Theobromine or Allicin. Be careful
  when eating chocolate, onions, or garlic, and avoid coffee and tea! Despite their dietary restrictions, they get
  hungry 33% faster than other species.

  ## Claws

  Rodentia have dull claws, which do a mixture of [color=orange]Blunt[/color] and [color=orange]Slashing[/color] damage.

  ## Sticky Fingers

  Rodentia can rummage in disposal units, potentially finding food and other useful trinkets! Unfortunately, their
  feet also have a tendency to get painfully caught in mousetraps, even if they're wearing shoes.

  ## Cheek Storage

  Rodentia can store small items in their cheeks. Having items in their mouth makes their speech unintelligible, and
  they will drop all items in their mouth if attacked, stunned, or shoved.

  ## Damage

  Due to being smaller and more fragile than other species, Rodentia take 30% more [color=orange]Blunt[/color] damage, and
  15% more [color=orange]Slashing[/color] and [color=orange]Piercing[/color] damage.

  ## Rodentia Naming Conventions

  Rodentia typically have names structured by a descriptor followed by a pet sounding first name.

  [bullet] Short-legged Noodle

  [bullet] Long-tail Chitters

  [bullet] Squeaky Cheesetail
