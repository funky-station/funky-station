    Space Station 14 is a game about surviving a disaster with incompetent and cruel people on a space station.

    Your character is not a stand in for yourself. At Funky Station, we believe this is the in-correct way to play the game. With that in-mind, we also believe in fully sharing what we think may be potentially triggering scenarios.

    Do not play Funky Station if you are sensitive to:

    - You losing control of your character
    - Violent crime
    - Interrogations
    - Being a victim to violent crime
    - Your own character dying
    - Witnessing others dying
    - Brainwashing
    - Body horror
    - You playing someone elses character, or parts of your characters appearance changing
    - Being framed for a crime that you did not do

    Do not make a stand in for yourself. If you are not confident in your ability to distinguish what is part of the game and what isn't, do not play here.
