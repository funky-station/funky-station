  # Station Alert - Blue

  <Box>
    [italic]Called by: Anyone with Command-Level Access at a working Communications Console.[/italic]
  </Box>

  [bold]Conditions:[/bold]

  There is a suspected threat on board the station or at a nearby location in space. This includes any signs of hostile activity that have not caused any damage to the station or crew, but seems present.

  [italics]Minor threats such as theft, bar fights, and non-violent protests are not credible enough threats to elevate the alert level to blue.

  [bold]OR[/bold]

  Confirmed Code Red threats have been properly handled or subsided on their own. It is recommended that, after 10+ minutes on Code Red without any hostile activity, Code Blue be called.

  [bold]Secure Areas:[/bold]

  Anywhere else requiring command-level access.


  [bold]General Crew:[/bold]

  All personnel are highly recommended to maximize their Suit Sensors.

  Personnel are to report any suspicious activity to the nearest member of Security or their Department Head.

  Personnel are highly encouraged to exercise caution, even if the threat is only suspected. Following simple safety procedures (such as not going through Maintenance alone) can prevent needless accidents;

  Visitors to the station (anyone with Civilian-level access) are recommended to stay in public areas, for their safety.
