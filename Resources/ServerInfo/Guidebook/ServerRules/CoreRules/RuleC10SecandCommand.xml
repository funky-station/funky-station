  # Core Rule 10 - Security and Command Are Held to Higher Standards

  Security and Command players have a vital role in the round and are thus expected to know the basic mechanics of the game, the areas of their departments, and knowledge of Space Law and their respective SOPs.

  If you must leave as a member of Command, inform the rest of Command and head to Cryo. If you don't have time for this, leave a quick Ahelp.

  If you are temporarily role banned for failing to do either of these (ex: an emergency that didn't give you time), you can message the admins to revert the role ban upon returning.

  Consistent abuse of the authority Security and/or Command has will result in a role ban or regular ban.
