# Central Command Staff Punitive Measures

[bold]Class 1.[/bold] (IAA, NTR, Magistrate) Central Command staff may confiscate any [color=#134975]NanoTrasen[/color] equipment in the possession of crew or [color=#1b67a5]command[/color] as a penalty for misconduct;

[bold]Class 2.[/bold] (NTR, Magistrate) Central Command staff may impose a demotion upon crew or command as a penalty for egregious misconduct;

[bold]Class 3.[/bold] (Magistrate) Central Command staff may order the execution of staff in the case of egregious misconduct. This should be as a last resort, after other punishments have failed to lead to reform.

# If you need to deviate,

[bold]Document document document![/bold]
After action reports, calling [color=#009100]Central Command[/color] on the fabled red phone, or even praying will be heard by [color=#009100]Central Command[/color] and your actions may be excused if they were determined to be in the best interest of [color=#134975]NanoTrasen[/color].

## Central Command Staff OOC Rules and Expectations
[bold]0.[/bold] Central Command Staff are the highest authorities on station, but are present in an advisory and regulatory capacity only. If you want to [italic]actively[/italic] command the station or a department, these are not the roles you should be playing. There are generally no circumstances outside of your regulatory duties where you should be giving orders to [bold]ANYONE[/bold]. But, in the course of pursuing your [italic]regulatory[/italic] duties, you are above even the Captain in authority. As such, you are held to the absolute highest standard when it comes to following your respective SOP's, and adhereing to the spirit of your roles. Abuse of this trust will result in a permanent, non appealable role ban from CC roles. [bold]Your job is to make the round more fun through interesting role play, not just be an authoritarian power tripper[/bold].

[bold]1.[/bold] You should not assume that SOP and Space Law are static documents. Its okay to make mistakes, but especially when it comes to class [bold]two[/bold] or [bold]three[/bold] punitive measures, you should make an effort to double check you are correct in your ruling.

[bold]2.[/bold] You are a non combatant advisor, and should not be participating in combat except in the case of self defense. You should never [italic]initiate[/italic] combat through escalation, and in the case of extreme emergencies should only participate in combat as an absolute last resort.

[bold]3.[/bold] In general, Central Command staff are dignified representatives of Central Command. If you want to be silly or are easily bored, these are not the roles for you.
