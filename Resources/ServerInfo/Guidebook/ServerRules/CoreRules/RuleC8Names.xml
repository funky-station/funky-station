  # Rule 8 - Have an Appropriate Name

  If a name could reasonably appear on a driver's license in the year 3000, it's probably alright.

  Humanoid species like Humans, dwarves, felinids, and harpies must have both a first and last name.

  Other species should follow their species specific [textlink="naming scheme" link="NamingScheme"], have both a first name and last name like the humanoid species, or have reasonably alien sounds names.

  Names may contain prefixes, suffixes, and one nickname if reasonable.

  Admins may ask you to change your name if it's low-effort / overdone (John Central Command)

  No flat-out copying characters from popular media. A reference is okay, but give it enough variance to not be a straight up copycat character.
