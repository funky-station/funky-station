  # Atmospherics

  Atmospherics setups are a necessity for your long-term comfort, but are generally underdocumented, resulting in them being a bit tricky to set up. The following attempts to cover the basics.

  ## Standard Mix
  Breathing pure O2 or pure N2 is generally bad for the health of your crew, and it is recommended to instead aim for a mix of [color=#a4885c]78% N2 and 22% O2 at 101.24kPa.[/color] It's recommended that your gas mixer setup be set to output at least 300kPA for faster re-pressurization of rooms, without posing too much of an overpressurization risk, should traitors sabotage the distro.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NitrogenCanister"/>

  </Box>
  Variations on this mix may be necessary for the long-term comfort of atypical crew, (for example, Voxes, who are poisoned by Oxygen and breathe Nitrogen). For atypical crew (to be implemented), it is recommended to try and give them their own personal space, isolated by either an airlock or disposals section. Keep in mind that both methods are leaky and you will need scrubbers on both sides of the lock to clean up any leaked gasses.

  ## Vents and Scrubbers
  Vents and scrubbers are core atmospherics devices that fill and cleanse rooms, respectively. By default, they are configured for filling rooms to standard pressure (101.24kPa) and to remove all non-O2/N2 gasses from a room. They can be reconfigured from their default settings by linking them to an Air Alarm, allowing you to configure how they respond to various types of gasses or pressure levels.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasVentScrubber"/>
  </Box>
  During standard operation, if a normal vent detects that the outside environment is space, it will automatically cease operation until a minimum pressure is reached to avoid destruction of useful gasses. This can be fixed by pressurizing the room up to that minimum pressure by refilling it with a gas canister (potentially multiple, if the room is of significant size).

  Should you encounter a situation where scrubbers aren't cleaning a room fast enough (and the "Siphon" functionality still cannot keep up), employ portable scrubbers by dragging them to the affected location and wrenching them down. They work much faster than typical scrubbers and can clean up a room quite quickly. Large spills may require you to employ multiple.

  # Gas mixes and Burn chambers
  In the event you finish all the tasks at hand, you can make some extra money by creating new chemical gasses.

  ##Tritium
  Tritium is a clear, green gas that is highly flammable, radioactive, and combusts when in contact with oxygen, making it very helpful when running the [color=#a4885c]TEG[/color].
  It can be made by burning 1% Plasma and 96% or more Oxygen in the Burn Chamber (Ideal ratio is 3% Plasma to 97% Oxygen). You can extract this gas through scrubbers.

  </Box>

  ##Pluoxium
  Pluoxium is a non-reactive Oxygen substitute that delivers eight times as much O2 to the bloodstream, with as little 3 kPa minimum pressure required for internals.
  It can be made by combining 66% Carbon Dioxide, 33% Oxygen, 0.01% Tritium together in an exothermic reaction between 50 K and 273 K. Furthermore, Pluoxium is also created by the Supermatter, when Oxygen and CO2 are present.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PluoxiumCanister"/>
  </Box>

  ##BZ
  BZ gas is a potent hallucinogenic, as well as a sleeping agent for slimes. It is toxic to breathe and causes respiratory irritation and coughing. BZ sees frequent use as an ingredient in more complex gas reactions. 
  It can be made by combining 33% Nitrous Oxide and 66% Plasma in an exothermic reaction. The reaction becomes less efficient if the Plasma content is greater than 3 times the Nitrous Oxide Content. The reaction is fastest outside of pipes and in low pressure enviroments.

  </Box>

  ##Frezon
  Frezon is a bluish-green gas that is very complex and very dangerous.
  It can be made by combining 90% Oxygen, 8% Nitrogen, and 2% Tritium at or below 73.15 K. This reaction only uses Nitrogen as a catalyst, and does not consume Nitrogen.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirCanister"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasVentScrubber"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="FrezonCanister"/>
  </Box>

  It is critical to understand that a frezon leak can devastate the station, causing a wintery hell filled with itchy sweaters and cold burns. Frezon is very cold, and can freeze the station to death if even a few moles get out, so make sure that you lock your canisters or just move your Frezon straight into a storage room.

  ##Healium
  Healium is a red gas, formed in cold environments, which acts as a strong sleeping agent, while healing burns, bruises, and toxin damage. Excessive use will lead to inebriation. 
  It can be made by combining 81% Frezon and 9% BZ in an exothermic reaction.

  ##Nitrium
  Nitrium is a gaseous stimulant that when inhaled can enhance speed and endurance. At lower concentrations Nitrium will increase your top running speed while healthy and unimpaired. Additionally, at slightly higher concentrations, breathing Nitrium will prevent drowsiness. At high concentrations breathing it will begin to shut down a person's lungs, causing asphyxiation. 
  It can be made by combining 47.5% Nitrogen, 47.5% Tritium, and 5% BZ at or above 1500k degrees. With higher tempature giving greater efficiency.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasVentScrubber"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NitriumCanister"/>
  </Box>

  Nitrium degrades into nitrogen and hydrogen on contact with room temperature oxygen. This reaction can produce a good deal of heat, making the station uncomfortably warm in the event of a leak. 

  ##Hydrogen
  Hydrogen is a highly flammable but non-toxic gas that burns similarly to tritium, making it useful as a fuel source. It is produced by electrolyzing water vapor with an electrolyzer machine to produce hydrogen and oxygen.

  </Box>

  When mixed with BZ at temperatures below 273 K and pressures above 10 MPa, hydrogen can form metal hydrogen, a rare material. Handle hydrogen carefully to prevent fires or explosions, and store canisters securely.

  ##Proto-Nitrate
  Proto-Nitrate is a highly reactive, non-toxic gas. Combine 1 mole hydrogen with 0.1 moles pluoxium to yield 1.1 moles proto-nitrate exothermically, best at 5000-10000K. It reacts with hydrogen or tritium to adjust proto-nitrate or produce hydrogen, and with BZ at 260-280K to yield nitrogen, helium, and plasma. Handle carefully to avoid leaks.

  ##Zauker
  Zauker is a deadly gas if inhaled. Produce it by combining 0.2 moles hyper-noblium with 1 mole nitrium to yield 1 mole zauker exothermically. It decomposes with nitrogen into 0.3 moles oxygen and 0.7 moles nitrogen per mole zauker, also exothermic and inhibited similarly. Store securely to prevent leaks.

  </Box>

  ##Halon
  Halon suppresses fires by consuming oxygen, at a ratio of 20 moles oxygen per 1 mole halon, above 343.15 K in an endothermic reaction, producing carbon dioxide. It's made in an exothermic reaction by electrolyzing BZ, yielding 2 moles halon and 0.2 moles oxygen per mole BZ. Use cautiously to avoid oxygen depletion.

  ##Helium
  Helium is an inert, invisible gas produced as a byproduct of other reactions. It has minimal use in atmospherics, so scrub it to avoid diluting other gases.

  ##Anti-Noblium
  Anti-Noblium is a rare gas with niche uses, produced by electrolyzing hyper-noblium below 150 K, yielding 0.5 moles anti-noblium per mole hyper-noblium. Store carefully to preserve hyper-noblium stocks for other reactions.
