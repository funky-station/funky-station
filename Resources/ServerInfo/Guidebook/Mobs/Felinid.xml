  Felinids are a mutation of humans, sporting their signature ears and tail from your favourite japanese cartoons.

  ## Diet

  Felinids share evolutionary roots with cats, and so they cannot metabolize Theobromine or Allicin. Be careful
  when eating chocolate, onions, or garlic, and avoid coffee and tea! Despite their dietary restrictions, they get
  thirsty 20% faster than other species.

  ## Claws

  Felinids have razor sharp claws, so their unarmed attacks deal [color=orange]Slashing[/color] and [color=orange]Piercing[/color] damage.

  ## Padded Feet

  Felinids take less damage from falling and high-speed impacts, and can creep around silently when they're not wearing
  shoes, but are prone to being stunned quicker and have 25% less stamina than other species.

  ## Damage

  Felinids take 5% more [color=orange]Blunt[/color] damage than other species.
