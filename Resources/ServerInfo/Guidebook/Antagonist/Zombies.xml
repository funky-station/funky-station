  # Zombies
  
  <Box>
    [color=#999999][bold]Zombies [/bold]are a team-based cooperative conversion antagonist. Zombies may be encountered through exposure to the virus Romerol, which can be purchased by Syndicate nuclear operatives or potentially discovered in maintenance pills, or through contact with a Patient Zero[/color]

  Zombies are conversion antagonists created by a physical tumor that infects the host with [color=#7e916e]Romerol[/color], a deadly and contagious virus. This tumor spreads the infection throughout the body over time. Fully zombified individuals can also spread the infection directly through biting.

## Infection Progression

Zombie infection progresses through several distinct stages over time. [bold]If the patient dies at any stage, they will instantly be reanimated as a walking dead![/bold]

### Stage 1; Asymptomatic
During the early period following infection, the patient will display [bold]no visible symptoms[/bold] or ill effects. [bold]Ambuzol 1 can be used[/bold] to cure the infection during this stage before symptoms begin to appear.

### Stage 2; Early
As the infection progresses, [bold]persistent coughing will begin, marking the onset of airborne transmission to those around the infected.[/bold] Wearing a face covering, such as a surgical mask or gas mask, significantly reduces the chance of contracting an airborne infection. Activating internals, such as using an emergency oxygen tank, effectively prevents airborne transmission. Around this stage, patients will begin to experience mild poison damage. This damage is easily identifiable using a health HUD or medical scanner. Gradual poison damage with no identifiable source is often sufficient to indicate early infection, provided the examining medical personnel are paying adequate attention.

### Stage 3; Advanced
As the infection advances further, [bold]zombie blood will begin replacing the patient’s normal blood[/bold]. This causes the patient to take [bold]significantly increased damage[/bold]. Drawing blood and placing it in a chem master will confirm infection at this stage. Patients will also begin to experience feelings of paranoia during this stage.

### Stage 4; Terminal
In the final stage of infection, poison damage becomes extremely severe, making survival difficult. Patients will begin to display aggressive behavior by this point. [bold]If the patient remains alive long enough in this stage, full zombification will occur automatically.[/bold]

## Surgical Treatment

[bold]The infection is caused by a physical tumor located on a random part of the patient’s body. If this tumor is surgically removed before zombification, all symptoms immediately cease, and the patient is fully cured.[/bold] A health analyzer can identify the tumor’s location for surgery. This procedure does not require the use of a surgical bed; any bed or roller bed is sufficient. Once the tumor is removed, it must be ground or burned to prevent cross-contamination.

## Chemical Treatment

The drug [bold]Ambuzol[/bold] is used to treat zombie infections in graded formulations. Each tier of Ambuzol corresponds to a specific infection stage:

Ambuzol 1 cures Stage 1 infections  
Ambuzol 2 cures Stage 2 infections  
Ambuzol 3 cures Stage 3 infections  
Ambuzol 4 cures Stage 4 infections  

[bold]Ambuzol 5 will cure zombie infection at any stage[/bold], provided the patient has not already undergone full zombification. Additionally, Ambuzol 5 permanently immunizes the patient against all future zombie infections. Ambuzol has no overdose threshold and may be administered freely. 

Once an individual has undergone full zombification, curing is no longer possible except through cloning procedures. Infected individuals remain highly viral even while dead. Dispatched zombies must be ejected into space, cremated, ground into biomass, or have the tumor surgically removed from the corpse to prevent further spread. Secure quarantine and transport to Central Command for cloning or borging is also acceptable where feasible.

## Bite-Based Transmission

Zombie infection may also be transmitted through physical bites. Fully zombified individuals possess a powerful bite attack. When biting a victim, the zombie will partially heal itself and has a chance to transmit infection to the bitten individual. Unclothed victims face a very high likelihood of infection per bite. [bold]Wearing clothing reduces this chance progressively[/bold], down to a minimal chance when maximum coverage is worn. Use of a bio-suit or some kinds of hardsuits, such as CBURN gear, can reduce infection chances further. Each bite calculates infection chance independently. Multiple bites greatly increase the likelihood of infection, even when substantial protective equipment is worn. [bold]Any critical or dead lifeform bit by an infected will instantly reanimate the victim.[/bold] This includes animals or other antagonists such as slimes, spiders, carp, rat kings, or dragons.

## How to Combat Zombies

Once zombified, zombies lose the ability to communicate verbally, reason in complex structures, and utilize equipment. Upon transformation, they drop gloves and medical items and rely entirely on their bite for offense. This makes zombies extremely dangerous at close range but ineffective at distance. The most reliable method of survival is to prevent zombies from closing distance. Zombies are slow-moving [bold]but take reduced damage from nearly all conventional sources, with the notable exception of heat-based damage[/bold]. The following countermeasures are considered highly effective:

• Incendiary ammunition  

• Laser weaponry  

• Welding tools, including emergency welders found in standard emergency toolboxes  

• Electric grills and electric fencing, which cause severe damage and can quickly neutralize groups by stunning them while they are engaged at range  

• Engaging through windows with lasers to maintain distance while dealing sustained damage  

Due to their resistance to most brute and ballistic damage and immunity to space, maintaining distance and utilizing grills and windows is imperative.

## Playing a Zombie

Playing a zombie differs significantly from nearly all other antagonist roles. Zombies are, by nature, unintelligent and operate on simple instincts rather than complex reasoning. Because of this, [bold]zombies are only permitted to attack for one of the following purposes[/bold]:

• Gaining additional infections  

• Destroying obstacles directly blocking the path to infecting others  

Zombies should ignore silicons entirely unless those entities actively interfere. If a silicon becomes hostile, it may be incapacitated only and [bold]must not be destroyed[/bold]. [bold]If an individual has been killed and does not convert after sustained biting, zombies must cease biting immediately and move on. Corpses that cannot be converted should be ignored entirely.[/bold] Zombies are not permitted to guard bodies to prevent recovery, [bolditalic]nor are they allowed to intentionally destroy critical infrastructure.[/bolditalic] This includes telecommunications systems, communications consoles, and deliberate spacing or sabotage of rooms solely to render them uninhabitable for non-zombified crew. Zombie bites cause significant structural damage and should be used exclusively to clear paths toward living targets. Zombies may chew through walls, doors, windows, and other obstructions that impede movement toward potential infections. Zombies may also use alt-click interactions to pry open doors, including bolted doors, functioning similarly to a Jaws of Life.

## Patients Zero

The Patient Zero game mode is the standard zombie game mode. In this mode, several individuals are randomly selected partway into the round to become infected, starting at Stage 1. Patients Zero are not informed of their status and must not act as antagonists prior to zombification.
