# Mime

  [bold]1.[/bold] The Mime is [bold]not permitted to talk[/bold], under any circumstance whatsoever. A Mime who breaks the Vow of Silence is to be stripped of their rank post haste;

  [bold]2.[/bold] The Mime is permitted to use written words to communicate, either via paper or PDA, but are discouraged from automatically resorting to it when miming will suffice;

  [bold]3.[/bold] The Mime must actually mime something at least once every thirty (30) minutes. Standing against an invisible wall will suffice.
