# Blood Cult

[color=#ff3333][italic]The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.[/italic][/color]

The blood cult is a loosely-organized group of acolytes dedicated to an interdimensional being: [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie, the Geometer of Blood[/color]. For as long as its existence has been documented, its main goal has been to identify a location suitable for the barriers between spatio-temporal dimensions -- the "veil" -- to be broken down. It is theorized that, if they were to accomplish this, an [color=#ff3333]unspeakable horror of ancient power[/color] that wishes to bring ruin to the universe and shape it into their image would be brought forth into our reality.

Obviously, this cannot be allowed to occur.

Unfortunately for the station, it looks like Nanotrasen accidentally positioned it near an undetectable weak point in time and space. Whoops. Who would've known?

As a blood cultist, the only being you love more than your fellow acolytes is [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie Herself[/color]. Be kind to one another, teach each other the tricks and tools of the trade, and remember that only through complete co-operation can you achieve your [color=#dd55aa]goal[/color].

You can become a blood cultist both at the beginning of the round and by being converted by existing acolytes. Cultists may also, instead, choose to trap your soul in a stone to do their bidding.

## Quick Guide to Being a Cultist

Is this your first time playing as a Blood Cultist? Give this section a read -- it will help you get a grasp of the basics!

[bold]- Staying Hidden[/bold]

The longer your cult stays hidden, the more powerful you will be able to grow without facing resistance from the station's crewmembers. Until your cult has revealed themselves, avoid outwardly presenting cult-related abilities or objects!

[bold]- Communing[/bold]

One of the first things you should do is find somewhere secluded to use your [bold]Commune[/bold] ability (check your hotbar) in order to let your fellow acolytes know that you exist. This ability works over any distance, but beware -- you whisper an incantation when using it!

[bold]- Preparing Blood Magic[/bold]

Your [bold]Prepare Spell[/bold] ability will allow you to carve spells into your flesh, at the cost of taking some damage (depending on the spell). Your hands don't need to be free to do this -- you can even do it while handcuffed! After a spell has been prepared, you can use it at any time you wish by activating the spell in your hotbar. Preparing spells takes a little while to do, though, and will be obvious to any outside observers. The first spells you probably want are Summon Dagger and Stun.

[bold]- Establishing a Cult Base[/bold]

Once you have made contact with your fellow cultists, you should meet up and establish a hidden base somewhere aboard the station that will allow you to perform cult activities and start placing runes without being seen. Secret doors in the maintenance tunnels make for good disguises!

[bold]- Placing Runes[/bold]

Using the cult dagger you may summon with the Summon Dagger spell, you can start painting runes into the floor! Click the dagger in your hand, pick the rune you want, then click yourself with the dagger to begin doing this. Offering runes will allow you to begin sacrificing people and converting new cultists, and empowering runes will allow you to prepare more than one spell at once.

[bold]- Converting your Crewmates[/bold]

If a [bold]living, non-mindshielded[/bold] crewmember who is [bold]not your cult's primary target[/bold] is placed atop an offering rune, and if the rune is then activated with [bold]at least two (2) cultists and/or constructs[/bold] standing on the tiles neighboring the rune, the victim will be converted into your cult! Early expansion is imperative -- but beware, for expanding your cult too much will make your Blood Cultist nature difficult to hide.

If the victim is dead or mindshielded, they will instead violently explode, leaving behind a soul stone containing their trapped soul. This is still a positive outcome, as you may use the soul stone in your hand to summon a servant Shade construct!

[bold]- Building Structures[/bold]

When you become a cultist, you start with 10 runed metal in your backpack. By opening the Build menu (press "G") and typing in "cult," you can see a list of structures that can be built using this metal. Pylons and Forges are imperative for the success of your cult, but be sure to place them somewhere they won't be seen (such as inside a cult base).

If you don't have enough runed metal, more can be created from stacks of plasteel using the Twisted Construction spell.

[bold]- Enslaving Constructs[/bold]

Soul stones (obtained by sacrificing players on an offering rune) can be used to create constructs -- non-verbal monstrosities that can participate in rune rituals, hear your Communes, and must obey your every command! Shades can be summoned by just clicking a filled soul stone in your hand (and can then be recalled and fully healed by clicking them again with the empty soul stone), but Juggernauts must first be constructed via the Build Menu ("G") before inserting a soul stone.

[bold]- Revealing your Cult[/bold]

Whether by accident or on purpose, your cult's presence will eventually become known to the crew. Ideally, when this happens, you should have an army of fellow acolytes and constructs ready to defend you from those who would foil your grand plans!

[bold]- Summoning your God[/bold]

The first step to summoning [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie[/color] is to sacrifice the players [color=#ff3333]She[/color] tells you about through the Study Veil ability. These players will require [bold]three (3)[/bold] cultists standing around the offer rune to sacrifice. When two of these targets have been offered up, [color=#ff3333]the Geometer[/color] will tell you where you may draw the final rune. Drawing this rune will take 45 seconds, and the crew will be alerted to your location. Have [bold]at least nine (9)[/bold] cultists and/or constructs stand atop this rune, spread out evenly, and then activate the rune to summon [color=#ff3333]your God[/color] and give your cult the win!

## Your Cult Dagger

As a Blood Cultist, you should almost always have a cult dagger [bold]on your person[/bold] or a Summon Dagger spell [bold]prepared and ready to activate[/bold]. Your dagger is useful for just about everything cult-related, being able to:

- Draw new runes on the ground
- Erase runes to hide them
- Enhance the effect of a Stun spell by striking the victim after Stunning them
- Stab people

## Abilities

[color=#ff3333]Your patron[/color] has seen fit to empower [color=#ff3333]Her[/color] blood cultists with several basic abilities to help you on your quest.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistCommune" Caption="Commune"/>
	<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistStudyVeil" Caption="Study Veil"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistSpellsSelect" Caption="Prepare Spell"/>
  </Box>

The [bold]Commune[/bold] ability allows a cultist to speak to their fellow acolytes over any distance. However, an incantation will be audibly whispered. Beware of alerting the crew to your cult's presence too early through unwise use of this ability.

The [bold]Study Veil[/bold] ability allows a cultist to hear [color=#ff3333]the Geometer[/color]'s voice. Recieve your instructions through the use of this ability.

The [bold]Prepare Spell[/bold] ability allows [color=#ff3333]your patron[/color] to reach forth and carve [bold]Blood Spell[/bold] sigils onto your flesh. Only one blood spell may be prepared at a time, unless the user is standing atop an [color=#ff6666]empowering rune[/color].

## Blood Spells

Blood spells are incantations that must be physically carved into the invoker's skin by a [color=#ff3333]higher entity[/color] prior to their use. Fortunately for you, as the veil is thin in this sector of space, [color=#ff3333]your Patron[/color] is capable of reaching forth and etching the appropriate sigils onto your person without your hands needing to be free or unrestrained. Without the aid of an [color=#ff6666]empowering rune[/color], however, the carving will have to be a crude one, and there may only be enough room on your body for one sigil at a time.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistSummonDagger" Caption="Summon Dagger"/>
  </Box>

The summon dagger spell allows a cultist to instantly grant themselves a new cult dagger (both a weapon and a rune-carving tool). This spell is useful for new devotees and those who have lost their old daggers.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistStun" Caption="Stun"/>
  </Box>

The stun spell will temporarilly knock over, drain the stamina of, silence, and mark a victim. [bold]A marked victim may be struck once with a cult dagger to enhance the effects of a stun.[/bold] This spell may also be used to EMP Cyborgs.

This spell may permit you to silently and more efficiently kidnap those your cult requires, giving you ample time to strip them of their suit coordinates and communications headset prior to abduction. It is recommended that all cultists keep a stun spell prepared when roaming beyond their selected base of operations, [bold]just in case.[/bold]

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistTwistedConstruction" Caption="Twisted Construction"/>
  </Box>

The twisted construction spell allows cultists to convert stacks of plasteel into [color=#bbbbbb]runed metal[/color].

## Runes

Your bread-and-butter as a cultist are your [color=#ff6666]Runes.[/color] These sigils, painted in your own wrist's blood using a cult dagger, allow acolytes to draw upon the power of [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie[/color] at a concentrated physical location.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OfferingRune" Caption="the"/>
	<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="EmpoweringRune" Caption="runes"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ReviveRune" Caption="of"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BarrierRune" Caption="your cult"/>
  </Box>

[color=#ff6666]Runes[/color] can be drawn at your feet by activating a cult dagger in your hand, selecting a rune from the radial menu that appears, and then using the dagger on yourself. Beware -- this will hurt.

The most important runes you have available are the [color=#ff6666]offering rune[/color] and the [color=#ff6666]empowering rune[/color]. With these runes placed in a safe location, cultists may begin enacting [color=#dd55aa]the will of their mistress[/color].

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OfferingRune" Caption="offering rune"/>
  </Box>

The [bold][color=#ff6666]offering rune[/color][/bold] allows cultists to [color=#EEEE33]convert[/color] the weak-minded to their cause as well as [color=#99CC99]sacrifice[/color] the dead, the mindshielded, and [color=#dd55aa]those whose souls the[/color] [color=#ff3333]Geometer[/color] [color=#dd55aa]desires[/color].

The offering rune may be invoked by dragging a victim onto the rune, gathering the required number of cultists onto the eight (8) tiles surrounding the rune, and then activating the rune by clicking it with an empty hand or pressing E on it. However, the effect that the rune will have will change depending on whether your victim is dead, mindshielded, or your [color=#dd55aa]target[/color].

- If the victim is dead (or simply a head/brain), mindshielded, or your [color=#dd55aa]target[/color], the victim will be gibbed and [color=#99CC99]sacrificed[/color], producing a soul stone containing their trapped soul. If the victim is your designated [color=#dd55aa]target[/color], this will require [bold]three (3)[/bold] cultists or constructs to be present on the tiles surrounding the rune; otherwise, this can be done [bold]alone[/bold].
- If the victim is alive, not your [color=#dd55aa]target[/color], [bold]and unmindshielded[/bold], the victim will be [color=#EEEE33]converted[/color] into a brand-new Blood Cultist. [color=#EEEE33]Converting[/color] a victim requires [bold]two (2)[/bold] cultists or constructs to be standing on the tiles surrounding the rune.

Once a [color=#dd55aa]target[/color] is sacrificed, the veil will be weakened, and you will be given a new [color=#dd55aa]assignment[/color].

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="EmpoweringRune" Caption="empowering rune"/>
  </Box>

The [bold][color=#ff6666]empowering rune[/color][/bold] allows a cultist standing on it to prepare more than one blood spell at a time. In addition, the preparation of these spells will result in far less physical trauma to the envoker, and will be performed significantly faster.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ReviveRune" Caption="revive rune"/>
  </Box>

The [bold][color=#ff6666]revive rune[/color][/bold] may be used by cultists to ask [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie[/color] to restore the soul of a lost acolyte. A dead cultist may be dragged on top of this rune, and the rune subsequently activated, to make this request. However, [color=#ff3333]She[/color] may demand further sacrifices be made before deigning [color=#ff3333]herself[/color] to fetch this lost soul. A lesser-known function of the [color=#ff6666]revive rune[/color] is that it may be used to grant a new soul to an entirely catatonic acolyte -- one for whom no pre-existing soul still exists. Any random soul of the dead may inhabit this body.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BarrierRune" Caption="barrier rune"/>
  </Box>

The [bold][color=#ff6666]barrier rune[/color][/bold] allows the [color=#ff3333]Geometer[/color] to physically defend [color=#ff3333]Her[/color] followers through the use of magical barriers. When activated, an impenetrable forcefield will temporarily manifest above it, and any adjacent [color=#ff3333]barrier runes[/color] will be activated as well. There is no limit to the length of this chain, save for the fortitude of the invoker -- their blood will be drained for the ritual at a rate determined by the number of barriers produced.

## Structures

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CultPylon" Caption="Pylon"/>
	<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CultForge" Caption="Forge"/>
	<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CultJuggernautShell" Caption="Juggernaut Shell"/>
  </Box>

Structures are worldly objects that possess a mere drop of [color=#ff3333]Her[/color] being. Constructable using [color=#bbbbbb]runed metal[/color] via the crafting menu (the "G" key), these objects are a great boon to a developed cult.

Pylons will gradually heal those devoted to [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie[/color], including inhabited constructs. By merely existing near them, living devotees will continuously receive [color=#ff3333]Her[/color] blessing, knitting bone and sinew and undoing any half-baked attempts at deconversion.

Forges may be used to craft powerful weapons and armor; but this act of creation has a 4 minute cooldown.

Juggernaut shells are inert statues of [color=#bbbbbb]runed metal[/color]. They are completely useless... until an inhabited soul stone is inserted, at least.

## Constructs

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobBloodCultShade" Caption="Shade"/>
	<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobBloodCultJuggernaut" Caption="Juggernaut"/>
  </Box>

Constructs are non-verbal, barely-sentient minions of the blood cult. Made from the twisted souls sacrificed to the [color=#ff3333]Geometer[/color], these entities count towards completing rituals with [color=#ff6666]runes[/color], and may be used in place of living cultists in a pinch.

Shades are mostly-physical spirits produced by activating an inhabited soul stone in one's hand. Loyal to the one who freed them, Shades will stop at nothing to see their master's will enacted. What they lack in physical strength they make up for in speed and endurance -- a Shade may be re-captured in an empty soul stone to rejuvinate their health.

Juggernauts are hulking beasts made from juggernaut shells, awakened through the insertion of an inhabited soul stone. Slow and meticulous, these monstrosities are completely immune to weak attacks, and are capable of breaking down even the strongest of walls. An invaluable asset to a cult whose presence aboard the station is already known.

## The Final Ritual

When the veil has been sufficiently weakened, and your cult has grown sufficiently expanded, it will be time to summon [color=#ff3333]your master.[/color]

A new rune may be drawn at any of the three designated locations [color=#ff3333]She[/color] will tell you about. This rune will take a long time to prepare.

Once the process begins, Nanotrasen sensors are likely to pick up the exact location of your summoning attempt, and the crew will be alerted. Once the final rune is drawn, have [bold]at least nine (9)[/bold] cultists stand on top of it, spread out to cover as much surface area as possible.

Activate the rune once your fellow acolytes are appropriately perched upon it, and the process will be complete.

## Course of the Round

As the cult expands, the situation aboard the station will pass through several stages.

- 1. [color=#a4885c]Silent stage[/color] - The cult is still capable of existing in secrecy, and must sacrifice up to two [color=#dd55aa]targets[/color] designated by [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie[/color].
- 2. [color=#a4885c]Risen cult[/color] - Either the cult has expanded significantly in size, or the [color=#dd55aa]targets[/color] have all been sacrificed. The cultists can no longer hide their true nature.
- 3. [color=#a4885c]Veil sunderance[/color] - The cult has chosen a location to perform [color=#dd55aa]the final ritual.[/color] Nanotrasen sensors have detected the veil's collapse and will alert the crew.
- 4. [italic][color=#ff3333]she is here[/color][/italic] - [italic][color=#ff3333]despair[/color][italic]

## Combatting the Cult

The only known method of deconverting a blood cultist is through the forced imbibement of [color=#4466ff]holy water[/color] (at least 40u).

Your Chaplain, a holy being, is incapable of being [color=#EEEE33]converted[/color] or [color=#99CC99]sacrificed[/color] and is the only crewmember who may be trusted absolutely once the cult's presence is known. Chaplains are also highly resistant to blood magic and cult-manufactured weaponry, rendering the offensive abilities of most cultists useless against them -- unless the cultists resort to more traditional methods of attack.

Protect the Chaplain, for their holy water is the only thing that stands between you and [bold][color=#ff3333]consumption[/color][/bold].
