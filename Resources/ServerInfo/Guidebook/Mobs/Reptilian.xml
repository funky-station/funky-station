  Evolved from snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and all sorts of other reptiles, Reptilians are a hardy alien species.

  ## Claws

  Reptilian claws are sharp, and deal [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] damage.

  ## Diet

  Reptilians can only eat fruits, meat, and certain special foods like chocolate. They can, however, eat raw meat,
  paper, crayons, and drink blood without biological consequences.
  Your fellow crew might look at you differently, though...

  ## Temperature

  Reptilians are accustomed to a higher temperature range than humans, and get cold much quicker as a result.

  ## Tails

  Reptilians can drag objects and people with their tails, keeping both of their hands free.

  ## Drawbacks

  Reptilians take 30% more [color=#ec3a3a]Cold[/color] damage.
