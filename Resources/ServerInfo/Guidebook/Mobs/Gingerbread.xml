  Gingerbreads are a species of sentient confectionary, with sugar for blood and cookies for flesh.

  ## Cookie Biology

  Thanks to their anomalous sugar-based biology, Gingerbreads have sugar instead of blood, and can restore blood by
  eating candies and other sugary foods. They also take 75% less asphyxiation damage, 50% less heat damage, and are
  completely immune to bloodloss, cold, and cellular damage!

  ## Drawbacks

  Gingerbreads take 50% more blunt damage than other species.
  Gingerbreads are injured by water, becoming soggy and limp.
  Your crewmates might be tempted to butcher you to get cookies...
