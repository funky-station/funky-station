      I want to inform you about a very bad situation for you.  However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wisely.

      Have you heard of Syndicate?  This is a spyware program that installs on PDAs and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners.  It provides access to your coordinates, Nanochat, Crew Manifest, Notekeeper and Nanotask.  I guess, you already figured out what im getting at.

      As you can imagine in your worst dream, I have video of you exposed during the most private moments of your life when you are not expecting it.

      Here is the deal. I will delete the files after I receive 5,000 spesos.  You need to send that amount to nanochat #5YND1C473.  I will also clear your device from Syndicate malware, and you keep living your life.

      Otherwise shit will happen.
      This is non negotiable, to be transfered within 2 business days.
      Obviously do not try to ask for any help from anybody. I will montior your every move until I get paid.

      Take care.

      ────────────────────────────────────────
      Sincerely, The Syndicate.
