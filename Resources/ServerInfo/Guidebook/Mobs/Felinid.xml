  Felinids are a mutation of humans, sporting their signature ears and tail from your favourite japanese cartoons.

  ## Diet

  Felinids share evolutionary roots with cats, and so they cannot metabolize Theobromine or Allicin. Be careful
  when eating chocolate, onions, or garlic, and avoid coffee and tea!

  ## Claws

  Felinids have razor sharp claws, so their unarmed attacks deal [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] and [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage.

  ## Keen Senses

  Felinids take less damage from falling and impacts than other species thanks to their evolutionary roots!

  ## Padded Feet

  Felinids can creep around silently when they're not wearing shoes.

  ## Drawbacks

  Felinids take 15% more [color=#ec3a3a]Blunt[/color], [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] and [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage.
  Felinids take 30% more Cold damage than other species.
