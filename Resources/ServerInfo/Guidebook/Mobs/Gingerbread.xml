  Gingerbreads are a species of sentient confectionary, with sugar for blood and cookies for flesh.

  ## Cookie Biology

  Thanks to their anomalous sugar-based biology, Gingerbreads have sugar instead of blood, and can restore blood by
  eating candies and other sugary foods. They also take 50% less [color=#ec3a3a]Heat[/color] damage from fire, and are completely
  immune to [color=#ec3a3a]Asphyxiation[/color], [color=#ec3a3a]Bloodloss[/color], [color=#ec3a3a]Cold[/color], and [color=#ec3a3a]Cellular[/color] damage!

  ## Drawbacks

  Gingerbreads take 50% more [color=#ec3a3a]Blunt[/color] damage than other species.
  Gingerbreads are injured when splashed with water, becoming soggy and limp.
  Your crewmates might be tempted to butcher you to get cookies...
