This is a fork from the primary repo for Goob Station 14 called Funky Station. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, or for Goob Station, go to the [Space Station 14 repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14), or the [Goob Station repository](https://github.com/Goob-Station/Goob-Station).
