  # Rule 9 - Escalate Situations According to Context

  Non-antagonists may escalate into fights for various reasons. If you are inciting escalation / violence for a poor / no reason, you may be met with administrative action.

  Characters in critical condition should be treated or otherwise handed off to Med / Sec. The fight is considered over and should not be resumed without a good reason.

  Non-antagonists should not violently resist an arrest, but may evade capture.
  If an arrest is not obviously valid, it follows standard escalation. Resisting or retaliating against arrests without good reason may break the Escalation Policy and be handled administratively.
  In resisting arrest, non-antagonists should not loot officers and should not detain or incapacitate officers any longer than is necessary to escape or explain themselves.

  Antagonists and free agents must still follow heavily relaxed escalation when not dealing with their objectives or crewmembers that are in direct opposition to them.
