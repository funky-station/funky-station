  # Slime People

  Slime People are sentient blobs of non-newtonian fluid and organs who breathe nitrogen.

  ## Slime Core

  </Box>
  Among many other physiological differences, Slime People's organs are compressed into a single "core" located in
  their stomach region, acting as the brain, heart, eyes, stomach, kidneys, and liver. This core can process up to six
  reagents instead of the usual three.

  ## Breathing

  Slime People breathe nitrogen instead of oxygen, which is abundant in the station air, but harder to find compressed
  into gas tanks. They exhale nitrous oxide and are unaffected by it.
  Furthermore, Slime People asphyxiate five times slower than humans, making the rarity of nitrogen tanks less of a
  severe threat to their survivability in an emergency.

  ## Slime Storage

  Slime People have an [bold]internal 2x3 storage inventory[/bold] inside of their slime membrane. Anyone can see
  what's inside and take it out of them without asking, and thrown items can sometimes get stuck inside, so be careful.

  ## Slime Healing

  Slime People have a very slight accelerated regeneration compared to other humanoids, their slime coagulating at
  twice the rate of other species' and below 65 damage. This healing factor coincidentally also makes their slime a
  debatably nutritious source of food for other species.

  ## Damage

  Due to their non-newtonian biology, Slime People take 40% reduced [color=orange]Blunt[/color] damage and 20% reduced [color=green]Poison[/color],
  as well as 80% reduced [color=mediumpurple]Cellular[/color]. However, they also take 50% more [color=cornflowerblue]Cold[/color] damage,
  20% more [color=orange]Piercing[/color] damage, and 20% more [color=orange]Slashing[/color] damage. They suffer from barotrauma
  9% faster than other species, and they also become injured when splashed with water, as some of their slime is washed away.
