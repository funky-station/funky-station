## Security OOC Rules and Expectations
While being "serious" is not a job requirement for security, members of the security department [bold]should[/bold] take their job seriously. Other members of the crew are discouraged or actively forbidden by the rules to do securities job. So if you are [bold]also[/bold] not doing securities job, thats a problem.
