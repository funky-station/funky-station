  # Roleplay Rule 16 - Blueshield Rules
    - You are to protect the Nanotrasen Representative, and to periodically check in with station command members. You are not a Security Officer with extra access, so do not abandon your duties.
    - If you are dismissed by the Nanotrasen Representative, you may check in with the Captain or the highest ranking command member for guidance.
    - If there is no Nanotrasen Representative on board, you are to protect the highest ranking command member until one arrives onto the station.
    - You answer directly to Central Command.
    - Do not abuse your role, and use common sense. If you have questions or concerns, fax CentComm, or ask the Nanotrasen Representative for guidance.
    - Do not make yourself Captain or any other command job. If you want to be Captain, instead choose that role while in the lobby.
