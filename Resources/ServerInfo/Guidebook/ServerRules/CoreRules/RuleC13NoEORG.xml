  # Rule 13 - No End-Of-Round Griefing (EORG)
  EORG (End-of-Round-Grief) is not allowed. Act the same way you would before the roundend screen pops up.

  Antagonists with kill objectives should not pursue those objectives after the shuttle arrives at CentComm.

  Round-ending threats such as Heretics, Zombies, and Dragons may still pursue their objectives after the round has ended.
