  # Rule 4 - Admin Rulings are Final

  Admins are trusted volunteers, and as such have a lot of responsibility and freedom at the same time. They have the decision on how to enforce and interpret rules according to the server's policy, and may or may not enforce certain rules more strictly based on the needs of the server at any given moment.

  If you receive a ban or a role ban, you are to appeal rather than continue the conversation through Ahelps or Discord.

  If you feel an admin ruling is unjustified, or they are otherwise abusing their position, you may make an admin complaint, DM the Head Admin, or ask for clarification of the rules on the Discord.
