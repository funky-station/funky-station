  Gingerbreads are a species of sentient confectionary, with sugar for blood and cookies for flesh.

  ## Cookie Biology

  Thanks to their anomalous sugar-based biology, Gingerbreads have sugar instead of blood, and can restore blood by
  eating candies and other sugary foods. They also take 50% less [color=red]Heat[/color] damage from fire, and are completely
  immune to [color=cornflowerblue]Asphyxiation[/color], [color=red]Bloodloss[/color], [color=cornflowerblue]Cold[/color], and [color=mediumpurple]Cellular[/color] damage!
  However, others might be tempted to butcher their corpses for a source of delicious, sugary cookies...

  ## Damage

  Gingerbreads take 50% more [color=orange]Blunt[/color] damage than other species, as they're more fragile and more likely to crumble.
  They are also injured when splashed with water, becoming soggy and limp.
