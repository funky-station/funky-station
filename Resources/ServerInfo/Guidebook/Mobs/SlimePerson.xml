  # Slime People

  Slime people are sentient blobs of non-newtonian fluid and organs who breathe nitrogen.

  ## Slime Lungs

  Slime people breathe nitrogen instead of oxygen, which is abundant in the station air, but harder to find compressed
  into gas tanks. They exhale nitrous oxide and are unaffected by it. Slime people asphyxiate 80% slower than humans.

  ## Slime Metabolism

  Slime people can metabolize six reagents at once, instead of the usual two.

  ## Slime Storage

  Slime people have an [bold]internal 2x3 storage inventory[/bold] inside of their slime membrane. Anyone can see
  what's inside and take it out of you without asking, so be careful.

  ## Slime Healing

  Slime people have a very slight accelerated regeneration compared to other humanoids.

  ## Non-Newtonian Body

  Slimes take 40% reduced [color=#ec3a3a]Blunt[/color] damage and 20% reduced [color=#ec3a3a]Poison[/color], as well
  as 80% reduced [color=#ec3a3a]Cellular[/color]. Slime people also take pressure damage 9% faster than other species.

  ## Drawbacks

  Slime blood cannot be regenerated from iron. Additionally, slime blood is a source of debatably nutritious food for
  other species.
  Slimes take 50% more [color=#ec3a3a]Cold[/color] damage, 20% more [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage, and 20% more [color=#ec3a3a]Slashing[/color] damage.
