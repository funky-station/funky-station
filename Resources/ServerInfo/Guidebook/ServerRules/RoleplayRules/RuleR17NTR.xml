  # Roleplay Rule 17 - Nanotrasen Representative Rules
    - You are the liaison between Central Command and the Station. You should be periodically faxing CentComm with an update on how the station is doing.
    - You are to also guide the Station Heads, along with the Blueshield if needed. If you can't provide an answer, try faxing CentComm for one.
    - Do not abuse your extra access for malicious reasons. Only use it if you must.
    - Use common sense and remember that you are also held up to a high standard of play. Failure to do so will lead to a roleban from command or gameban from the server entirely.
    - You are not to promote yourself or convince another command member to promote you to a position within the chain of command. You are outside of it, and can only step in when there is NO command available.
    - You are not to relieve the Blueshield of their duties without approval from CentComm. They are there to protect you, and other important corporate assets.
