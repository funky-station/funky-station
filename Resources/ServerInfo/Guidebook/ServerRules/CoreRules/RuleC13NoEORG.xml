  # Rule 13 
  # No End-Of-Round Griefing (EORG)
  
  End-of-Round Grief (EORG) is classified, generally, as being needlessly violent or acting out-of-character once the round has literally or functionally ended, to the detriment of other players' enjoyment or immersion. To list specifics, instances of EORG can include the following:
  
  [bullet] Random deathmatch (usually abbrieviated as RDM)

  [bullet] Violence that was not mentioned in an ahelp prior to engaging in it. For instance, if you had an ongoing grudge with another character during the round, you should ahelp for permission before escalating it to End-of-Round violence.

  [bullet] Destruction, deconstruction, or gross defacing of any CentComm assets. This includes using an RCD or tools to tear down walls or spam the light fixtures, or using any kind of explosives at CentComm.

  [bullet] Any form of incredibly bothersome behavior, especially of which one could reasonably deem as uncharacteristic of how you have been roleplaying up until then. This means, for instance, you should not slip security as they're taking a prisoner to the CentComm brig, and you should not be stun-batoning people without reason.

  Centcomm is a place for people to destress, roleplay, and talk about the shift. While you do not have to engage in this, it is expected that you allow others to.

  Antagonists should not continue antagonistic actions once the evacuation shuttle has arrived at Central Command and the End-Round Summary screen appears.

  Note that this rule does not apply to round-ending or rule-skirting antagonists such as: Zombies, Space Dragons and their carps, Blobs, Ascended Heretics, or Nuclear Operatives.

  Attacking someone at CentComm because they were your kill objective, or because you found out they killed your friend through the post-game results screen, will still be seen as EORG.
