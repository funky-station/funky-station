# Roboticist SOP

## Code Green

[bold]1.[/bold] Roboticists are [bold]not[/bold] permitted to construct Combat Mechs without explicit permission from the [color=#1b67a5]Captain[/color] and/or the [color=#cb0000]Head of Security[/color]. An example of a Combat Mech is the Gygax;

[bold]3.[/bold] Roboticists are freely permitted to construct Cyborgs and all assorted equipment;

[bold]4.[/bold] Roboticists are to respect all Do-Not-Borg orders, and copies of orders are to be kept safe if possible. If no copy exists, an MMI Unit may refuse to be a Cyborg, and that wish must be respected;

[bold]5.[/bold] Roboticists must ensure that all Cyborgs are adhering to their laws and not malfunctioning. If a Cyborg is found to be breaking their laws, their MMI Unit or Positronic Brain must be preserved and placed into a new Cyborg chassis;

[bold]6.[/bold] Roboticists must keep at least one Positronic Brain activated if possible;

An exception is made for station-wide threats, but even after these threats are dealt with, the Mech must be delivered to the Armory.
