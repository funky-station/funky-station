  # Surgery
  Your usual weekly activity. By performing surgical operations on your patients, you can heal wounds, remove or add body parts, organs, and more.

  ## The Basics
  To start surgery your patient needs to be laying down, and ideally sedated.

  You will also need an operating table to perform more advanced surgeries, such as replacing limbs or organs. These can be made in Science if none are available.
  You may also find spare Operating Tables in maintenance.

  If they are not sedated, they will be in a lot of pain, which decreases their mood, and will make surgical wounds worse.

  </Box>

  You also need to wear protective gear such as a mask and gloves to prevent harming the patient due to contamination.

  </Box>

  ## Getting Started

  To engage in surgery, you'll need a set of surgical tools.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Scalpel" Caption="scalpel"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Retractor" Caption="retractor"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Hemostat" Caption="hemostat"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Drill" Caption="drill"/>

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Saw" Caption="saw"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Cautery" Caption="cautery"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BoneGel" Caption="bone gel"/>
    </Box>

  Once you've got tools in hand, interact with your patient to begin surgery. You'll be able to choose which part you want to operate on.

  ## Sterility

  Your tools will accumulate dirt and grime while you use them, requiring you to clean them.
  Unclean tools will cause your patient to take poison damage.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Scalpel" Caption="scalpel" />
  </Box>

  You can clean your tools by using soap on them. Be sure to also regularly clean or change your mask and gloves, as well.
  Using the same dirty tools between two or more patients will cause your tools to become filthy, so be sure to clean them regularly.

  ## Ghetto Surgery

  Certain non-surgical tools can be used in a pinch, use the scalpel examine icon to see how good or bad something is.
  An operating table is still required for certain medical procedures.

  </Box>

  They aren't ideal compared to real surgical equipment, but they'll do in a pinch!
