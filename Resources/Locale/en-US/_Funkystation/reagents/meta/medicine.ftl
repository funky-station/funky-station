reagent-name-libital = libital
reagent-desc-libital = A Common, but weak medicine used to heal brute trauma. Commonly added to other medicine due to it's low side effects.

reagent-name-probital = probital
reagent-desc-probital = A common analgesic which is effective at treating general brute trauma. It's useful for all types of beatings. Known to make movement slower.

reagent-name-salicylicacid = salicylic acid
reagent-desc-salicylicacid = A heavy-duty analgesic that stabilizes the severely beaten, but is barely effective on people with less wounds. Overdosing will reverse the effect however.

reagent-name-aiuri = aiuri
reagent-desc-aiuri = A Common, but weak medicine used to heal brute injuries. Commonly added to other medicine due to it's low side effects.

reagent-name-lenturi = lenturi
reagent-desc-lenturi = A common chemical that is effective at treating burn damage, but uses water inside your body, thus dehydrating you.

reagent-name-oxandrolone = oxandrolone
reagent-desc-oxandrolone = A heavy-duty chemical that stabilizes the severely burned, but is barely effective on people with less wounds. Overdosing will reverse the effect however.

reagent-name-salbutamol = salbutamol
reagent-desc-salbutamol = A heavy-duty chemical that stabilizes the suffocated and reverses the effect of bloodloss, but is ineffective on people with less wounds. Overdosing will reverse the effect however.
