  Consider SOP your new space bible, feature complete with ways to lethal people legally.

  # What is Standard Operating Procedure? (SOP)

  Standard Operating Procedure, from hereon out known as SOP, is how NanoTrasen is expected to run its facilities. This ensures proper treatment of prisoners, how to safely deal with certain situations, and how to identify positive threats on the station.
  Deviating from SOP is a big and conscious decision, and any actions you may take while deviating from SOP may be grounds for discipline and/or termination of your contract.

  # Isn't SOP just guidelines?

  Yes they are, but following them ensures to establish proper trust with the public. Otherwise, you may be regarded as "Shitsec", or even worse, "Shitsci", so its always wise to consult the appropriate SOP document for your department. If you need to break SOP, you better have a good reason to justify its breakage afterward.

  # Great, now where can I find the SOP for my department?
