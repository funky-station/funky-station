  # Roleplay Rule 15 - Command and Security must use Space Law as a guide
  All non-antagonist command and security roles must operate under [textlink="Space Law" link="SpaceLaw"]. This includes non-antagonists who are promoted to or gain a position during the round in any way. This also includes non-antagonists who are acting as a security role.

  Space Law violations should be prioritized based on severity and the current situation.

  This prohibits the preparing of syndicate items for an emergency, although syndicate contraband may be used if the situation is deemed dire enough.

  Open carrying syndicate contraband for no explicit purpose is a violation of space law and must be dealt with accordingly.

  ## Examples
  Acceptable:
  - After a war announcement, a security officer ignores crewmembers carrying contraband so that they can focus on preparing to defend the station.
  - A security officer disarms someone attacking them with an energy sword, then uses the sword to kill the attacker.
  - Carrying a dropped L6 after a group of traitors takes over the armory.

  Prohibited:
  - A security officer or command member carries around an energy sword in case of an emergency.

  - A security officer
  - The Captain
  - The Chief Engineer
