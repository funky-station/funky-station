  # Rule 13 - No End-Of-Round Griefing (EORG)
  EORG (End-of-Round-Grief) is not allowed. Act the same way you would before the roundend screen pops up.

  Antagonists with kill objectives should not pursue those objectives after the shuttle arrives at CentComm.

  Round-ending threats such as Empowered Heretics, Blob, Zombies, and Dragons may still pursue their objectives after the round has ended.

  Evac Shuttle bombings before the round ends are not allowed without first ahelping and receiving permission from an admin. If an admin does not respond, do not shuttlebomb.
