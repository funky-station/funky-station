# Blood Cult

[color=#ff3333][italic]The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.[/italic][/color]

The blood cult is a loosely-organized group of acolytes dedicated to an interdimensional being: [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie, the Geometer of Blood[/color]. For as long as its existence has been documented, its main goal has been to identify a location suitable for the barriers between spatio-temporal dimensions -- the "veil" -- to be broken down. It is theorized that, if they were to accomplish this, an [color=#ff3333]unspeakable horror of ancient power[/color] that wishes to bring ruin to the universe and shape it into their image would be brought forth into our reality.

Obviously, this cannot be allowed to occur.

Unfortunately for the station, it looks like Nanotrasen accidentally positioned it near an undetectable weak point in time and space. Whoops. Who would've known?

As a blood cultist, the only being you love more than your fellow acolytes is [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie Herself[/color]. Be kind to one another, teach each other the tricks and tools of the trade, and remember that only through complete co-operation can you achieve your [color=#dd55aa]goal[/color].

You can become a blood cultist both at the beginning of the round and by being converted by existing acolytes. Cultists may also, instead, choose to trap your soul in a stone to do their bidding.

## Abilities

[color=#ff3333]Your patron[/color] has seen fit to empower [color=#ff3333]Her[/color] blood cultists with several basic abilities to help you on your quest.

	<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistStudyVeil" Caption="Study Veil"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistSpellsSelect" Caption="Prepare Spell"/>
  </Box>

The [bold]Commune[/bold] ability allows a cultist to speak to their fellow acolytes over any distance. However, an incantation will be audibly whispered. Beware of alerting the crew to your cult's presence too early through unwise use of this ability.

The [bold]Study Veil[/bold] ability allows a cultist to hear [color=#ff3333]the Geometer[/color]'s voice. Recieve your instructions through the use of this ability.

The [bold]Prepare Spell[/bold] ability allows [color=#ff3333]your patron[/color] to reach forth and carve [bold]Blood Spell[/bold] sigils onto your flesh. Only one blood spell may be prepared at a time, unless the user is standing atop an [color=#ff6666]empowering rune[/color].

## Runes

Your bread-and-butter as a cultist are your [color=#ff6666]Runes.[/color] These sigils, painted in your own wrist's blood, allow acolytes to draw upon the power of [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie[/color] at a concentrated physical location.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ReviveRune" Caption="of"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BarrierRune" Caption="your cult"/>
  </Box>

[color=#ff6666]Runes[/color] can be drawn at your feet by activating a cult dagger in your hand, selecting a rune from the radial menu that appears, and then using the dagger on yourself. Beware -- this will hurt.

The most important runes you have available are the [color=#ff6666]offering rune[/color] and the [color=#ff6666]empowering rune[/color]. With these runes placed in a safe location, cultists may begin enacting [color=#dd55aa]the will of their mistress[/color].

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OfferingRune" Caption="offering rune"/>
  </Box>

The [bold][color=#ff6666]offering rune[/color][/bold] allows cultists to convert the weak-minded to their cause as well as sacrifice the dead, the mindshielded, and those whose souls the [color=#ff3333]Geometer[/color] desires.
- [color=#99CC99]Sacrificing[/color] an unimportant dead person is a simple task, and can be performed by as few as a single acolyte. To accomplish this, merely drag the dead person's body, severed head, or brain onto an [color=#ff6666]offering rune[/color], then activate the rune by clicking it with an empty hand or by pressing E on it. Performing this ritual will trap the victim's soul in a soul stone, which may be found among the blood and offal atop the rune.
- [color=#EEEE33]Converting[/color] a living, weak-minded individual to your cause -- an individual who is not mindshielded, not a Chaplain, and not the [color=#dd55aa]target[/color] designated by your [color=#ff3333]master[/color] -- is marginally more complex in its execution than sacrificing an insignificant crewmember. The victim must be dragged onto the [color=#ff6666]offering rune[/color] while still alive. At least [bold]two (2)[/bold] cultists must stand on the tiles adjacent to the [color=#ff6666]rune[/color] before activating it. A successful ritual will produce a new acolyte to the [color=#ff3333]Geometer[/color] and significantly replenish their health.
- [color=#99CC99]Sacrificing[/color] your [color=#dd55aa]target[/color] -- a crewmember whose identity may be told to you by the [color=#ff3333]Geometer[/color] herself through the use of the [bold]Study Veil[/bold] ability -- is a similar process to [color=#99CC99]sacrificing[/color] an unimportant crewmember. However, as this [color=#dd55aa]individual[/color] possesses a soul of surpassing might, [bold]three (3)[/bold] cultists must be standing around the [color=#ff6666]rune[/color] to perform the ritual. If successful, the veil will be weakened, and you will be given a new [color=#dd55aa]assignment[/color].

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="EmpoweringRune" Caption="empowering rune"/>
  </Box>

The [bold][color=#ff6666]empowering rune[/color][/bold] allows a cultist standing on it to prepare more than one blood spell at a time. In addition, the preparation of these spells will result in far less physical trauma to the envoker, and will be performed significantly faster.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ReviveRune" Caption="revive rune"/>
  </Box>

The [bold][color=#ff6666]revive rune[/color][/bold] may be used by cultists to ask [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie[/color] to restore the soul of a lost acolyte. A dead cultist may be dragged on top of this rune, and the rune subsequently activated, to make this request. However, [color=#ff3333]She[/color] may demand further sacrifices be made before deigning [color=#ff3333]herself[/color] to fetch this lost soul. A lesser-known function of the [color=#ff6666]revive rune[/color] is that it may be used to grant a new soul to an entirely catatonic acolyte -- one for whom no pre-existing soul still exists. Any random soul of the dead may inhabit this body.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BarrierRune" Caption="barrier rune"/>
  </Box>

The [bold][color=#ff6666]barrier rune[/color][/bold] allows the [color=#ff3333]Geometer[/color] to physically defend [color=#ff3333]Her[/color] followers through the use of magical barriers. When activated, an impenetrable forcefield will temporarily manifest above it, and any adjacent [color=#ff3333]barrier runes[/color] will be activated as well. There is no limit to the length of this chain, save for the fortitude of the invoker -- their blood will be drained for the ritual at a rate determined by the number of barriers produced.

## Blood Spells

Blood spells are incantations that must be physically carved into the invoker's skin by a [color=#ff3333]higher entity[/color] prior to their use. Fortunately for you, as the veil is thin in this sector of space, [color=#ff3333]your Patron[/color] is capable of reaching forth and etching the appropriate sigils onto your person without your hands needing to be free or unrestrained. Without the aid of an [color=#ff6666]empowering rune[/color], however, the carving will have to be a crude one, and there may only be enough room on your body for one sigil at a time.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistSummonDagger" Caption="Summon Dagger"/>
  </Box>

The summon dagger spell allows a cultist to instantly grant themselves a weapon and a rune-carving tool. Useful for new devotees and those who have lost their old daggers.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistStun" Caption="Stun"/>
  </Box>

The stun spell will temporarilly knock over, drain the stamina of, silence, and mark a victim. A marked victim may be struck once with a cult dagger to enhance the effects of a stun. This spell may also be used to EMP Cyborgs.

This spell may permit you to silently and more efficiently kidnap those your cult requires, giving you ample time to strip them of their suit coordinates and communications headset prior to abduction. It is recommended that all cultists keep a stun spell prepared when roaming beyond their selected base of operations, [bold]just in case.[/bold]

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ActionCultistTwistedConstruction" Caption="Twisted Construction"/>
  </Box>

The twisted construction spell allows cultists to convert stacks of plasteel into [color=#bbbbbb]runed metal[/color].

## Structures

  <Box>

	<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CultJuggernautShell" Caption="Juggernaut Shell"/>
  </Box>

Structures are worldly objects that possess a mere drop of [color=#ff3333]Her[/color] being. Constructable using [color=#bbbbbb]runed metal[/color] via the crafting menu (the "G" key), these objects are a great boon to a developed cult.

Pylons will gradually heal those devoted to [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie[/color], including inhabited constructs. By merely existing near them, living devotees will continuously receive [color=#ff3333]Her[/color] blessing, knitting bone and sinew and undoing any half-baked attempts at deconversion.

Juggernaut shells are inert statues of [color=#bbbbbb]runed metal[/color]. They are completely useless... until an inhabited soul stone is inserted, at least.

## Constructs

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobBloodCultShade" Caption="Shade"/>
	<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobBloodCultJuggernaut" Caption="Juggernaut"/>
  </Box>

Constructs are non-verbal, barely-sentient minions of the blood cult. Made from the twisted souls sacrificed to the [color=#ff3333]Geometer[/color], these entities count towards completing rituals with [color=#ff6666]runes[/color], and may be used in place of living cultists in a pinch.

Shades are mostly-physical spirits produced by activating an inhabited soul stone in one's hand. Loyal to the one who freed them, Shades will stop at nothing to see their master's will enacted. What they lack in physical strength they make up for in speed and endurance -- a Shade may be re-captured in an empty soul stone to rejuvinate their health.

Juggernauts are hulking beasts made from juggernaut shells, awakened through the insertion of an inhabited soul stone. Slow and meticulous, these monstrosities are completely immune to weak attacks, and are capable of breaking down even the strongest of walls. An invaluable asset to a cult whose presence aboard the station is already known.

## The Final Ritual

When the veil has been sufficiently weakened, and your cult has grown sufficiently expanded, it will be time to summon [color=#ff3333]your master.[/color]

A new rune may be drawn at any of the three designated locations [color=#ff3333]She[/color] will tell you about. This rune will take a long time to prepare.

Once the process begins, Nanotrasen sensors are likely to pick up the exact location of your summoning attempt, and the crew will be alerted. Once the final rune is drawn, have [bold]at least nine (9)[/bold] cultists stand on top of it, spread out to cover as much surface area as possible.

Activate the rune once your fellow acolytes are appropriately perched upon it, and the process will be complete.

## Course of the Round

As the cult expands, the situation aboard the station will pass through several stages.

- 1. [color=#a4885c]Silent stage[/color] - The cult is still capable of existing in secrecy, and must sacrifice up to two [color=#dd55aa]targets[/color] designated by [color=#ff3333]Nar'Sie[/color].
- 2. [color=#a4885c]Risen cult[/color] - Either the cult has expanded significantly in size, or the [color=#dd55aa]targets[/color] have all been sacrificed. The cultists can no longer hide their true nature.
- 3. [color=#a4885c]Veil sunderance[/color] - The cult has chosen a location to perform [color=#dd55aa]the final ritual.[/color] Nanotrasen sensors have detected the veil's collapse and will alert the crew.
- 4. [italic][color=#ff3333]she is here[/color][/italic] - [italic][color=#ff3333]despair[/color][italic]

## Combatting the Cult

The only known method of deconverting a blood cultist is through the forced imbibement of [color=#4466ff]holy water[/color] (at least 40u).

Your Chaplain, a holy being, is largely immune to the more [italic]persuasive[/italic] aspects of the blood cult's methods, and is the only crewmember who may be trusted absolutely once the cult's presence is known. Chaplains are also resistant to blood magic and cult-manufactured weaponry, rendering the offensive abilities of most cultists useless against them -- unless the cultists resort to more traditional methods of attack.

Protect the Chaplain, for their holy water is the only thing that stands between you and [bold][color=#ff3333]consumption[/color][/bold].
