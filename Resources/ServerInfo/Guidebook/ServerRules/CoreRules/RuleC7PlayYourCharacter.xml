  # Rule 7 - Play your Character

  ## There are no main characters.

  Be a believable, if not normal person.

  Keep OOC out of IC chats, and keep IC chats out of OOC while a round is going on. If teaching a new player, for example, use LOOC, or try your best to incorporate it into the roleplay.

  Your character's life is important, value it. Avoid making decisions that no reasonable person would make. (Like trying to take on threats alone, or agreeing to be turned into food.)

  Playstyles that disregard all opportunities for engagement and roleplay can be met with administrative action.

  Stay in your lane regarding your role with the exception of emergencies and other extenuating circumstances. Security should not be performing surgery, and Salvage Specialists should not be performing security duties. Though Crew should be the last line of defense if all other means fail. This applies to non-antagonists intentionally making Security's life harder for no roleplay reason whatsoever.

  Do not suicide upon being caught or converted by an antagonist (ghouls, mind control, revolutionaries, etc.)

  ## Have an Appropriate Name

  If a name could reasonably appear on a driver's license in the year 2984, it's probably alright. Humanoid species like Humans, dwarves, felinids, and harpies must have both a first and last name. Other species should follow their species specific [textlink="naming scheme" link="NamingScheme"], have both a first name and last name like the humanoid species, or have reasonably alien sounding names. Names may contain prefixes, suffixes, and one nickname if reasonable.   No flat-out copying characters from popular media. A reference is okay, but give it enough variance to not be a straight up copycat character.

  Admins may ask you to change your name if it's low-effort / overdone (John Central Command)

  ## Act and behave within the spirit of the Job you have been assigned.

  Security and Command Are Held to Higher Standards. Security and Command players have a vital role in the round and are thus expected to know the basic mechanics of the game, the areas of their departments, and knowledge of Space Law and their respective SOPs.

  If you must leave as a member of Command, inform the rest of Command and head to Cryo. If you don't have time for this, leave a quick Ahelp.

  If you are temporarily role banned for failing to do either of these (ex: an emergency that didn't give you time), you can message the admins to revert the role ban upon returning.

  Consistent abuse of the authority Security and/or Command has will result in a role ban or regular ban.

  These roles have job specific OOC rules and expectations listed in their SOP that, if broken, can lead to permanent role bans for acting far outside of the intended spirit of the role.
  These rules apply to you even if you are promoted into a position listed here. Even if you are an antagonist you will still be held accountable to the role expectations in all gameplay aspects that do not [bold]directly[/bold] relate to antagonist objectives.
