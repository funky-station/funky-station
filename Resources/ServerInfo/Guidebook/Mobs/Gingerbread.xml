  Gingerbreads are a species of sentient confectionary, with sugar for blood and cookies for flesh.

  ## Cookie Biology

  Thanks to their anomalous sugar-based biology, Gingerbreads have sugar instead of blood, and can restore blood by
  eating candies and other sugary foods. Their organs are made of candy, and they don't need to eat or drink. They also take 30% less [color=red]Heat[/color] damage, 20% less [color=cornflowerblue]Shock[/color] damage and are immune to cold weather damage!
  However, others might be tempted to butcher or eat their corpses for a source of delicious, sugary delight...

  ## Damage

  Gingerbreads take more brute damage than other species in the form of 30% more [color=orange]Blunt[/color] damage and 20% more [color=orange]Slash[/color] and [color=orange]Piercing[/color] damage, as they're more fragile and more likely to crumble.
  They are also injured when splashed with water, taking [color=orange]Blunt[/color] damage becoming soggy and limp.

  ## Gingerbread Naming Conventions

  Gingerbread typically have food or baking themed names.

  [bullet] Sugarbottoms

  [bullet] Gumdrop Gus

  [bullet] Johnny Dough
