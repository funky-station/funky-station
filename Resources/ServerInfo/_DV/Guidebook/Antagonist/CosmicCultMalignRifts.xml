  As your cult progresses, [color=#4cabb3]Malign Rifts[/color] will begin to spawn throughout the surrounding environment. These rifts in realspace bleed unstable astral power, and should be located as soon as possible!

  Malign Rifts can be expunged by an [color=Yellow]A.P.E[/color] set to [bold]Λ-stabilizer particles[/bold].

  Cultists may stealthily [color=#4cabb3]absorb[/color] a Malign Rift by interacting with it.

  Successful absorbtion of a Malign Rift will [bold]permanently[/bold] empower the cultist doing so, increasing the strength of all the [color=#4cabb3]Influences[/color] they possess, and doubling the [color=#4cabb3]Entropy[/color] they gain from siphoning crewmembers. Empowered cultists also no longer need to breathe, and are immune to the vaccuum of space. Empowered cultists also gain the [color=#4cabb3]Null Fragmentation[/color] influence, which can be used to convert a Cyborg into an [color=#4cabb3]Entropic Colossus[/color], or to corrupt the station AI's laws.
