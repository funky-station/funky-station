  # Rule 13 - The MRP Has a Higher Expectation of Roleplay
  The roleplay server, Scarlet, has a higher expectation of roleplay and admins have justification to take action to keep the environment roleplay-friendly.

  EORG (End-of-Round-Grief) is not allowed on the MRP server. Act the same way you would before the roundend screen pops up.
