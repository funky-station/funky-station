# Janitor SOP

  [bold]1.[/bold] The Janitor must promptly respond to any call from the crew for them to clean. Failure to respond within fifteen (15) minutes is to be considered a breach of Standard Operating Procedure;

  [bold]2.[/bold] If the Janitor's work leaves any surface slippery, they are to place wet floor signs, either physical or holographic. During station ending threats the Janitor is to refrain from creating any slippery surfaces whatsoever;

  [bold]3.[/bold] The Janitor is [bold]not[/bold] to use Cleaning Foam Grenades as pranking implements. Cleaning Foam Grenades are to be used to clean large surfaces at once, only;

  [bold]4.[/bold] During Viral Outbreaks, the Janitors must don their Biosuit, and focus on cleaning any biological waste, until such a point as the Viral Pathogen is deemed eliminated;

  [bold]5.[/bold] The Janitor may not deploy bear traps anywhere, unless there are actually large wild animals on the station.

  [bold]6.[/bold] The Janitor is responsible for restocking any vending machines on the station. If any one item is out of stock in a machine, a restock should be ordered and be put into the machine.
