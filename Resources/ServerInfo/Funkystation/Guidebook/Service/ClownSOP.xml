# Clown SOP

  [bold]1.[/bold] The Clown is permitted to, and freely exempt from any consequences of, slipping [italic]literally [bolditalic]anyone[/bolditalic][/italic], assuming it does not interfere with active [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] duty, or in any way endangers other personnel (such as slipping a [color=#5b97bc]Paramedic[/color] who’s dragging a wounded person to Medbay);

  [bold]2.[/bold] The Clown is not permitted to remove their Clown Shoes or Clown Mask. Exception is made if removing them is truly necessary for the sake of their clowning performance (such as being a satire of bad clowns);

  [bold]3.[/bold] The Clown is [bold]not[/bold] permitted to use or be in possession of Space Lube. Exception is made during major emergencies involving hostile humanoids, whereby use of Space Lube may be condoned to help the crew;

  [bold]4.[/bold] The Clown must legitimately attempt to be funny and/or entertaining at least once every fifteen (15) minutes. A simple pun will suffice. Continuously slipping people for no reason does [bold]not[/bold] constitute humour. The joke is supposed to be funny for everyone;

  [bold]5.[/bold] The Clown is permitted to, and freely exempt from any consequences of, performing any harmless prank that does not directly conflict with the above Guidelines.
