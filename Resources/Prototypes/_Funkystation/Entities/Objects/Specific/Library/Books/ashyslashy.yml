      By Jack Grey
      ================================================
      Across the sectors a thousand tales of unbelievable, unscientific superstition abound. Enough that this author has greeted each with, at best, skepticism and at worst derision. In the past fifteen years only one story I’ve found holds any water – that of a man named Ashley Boggart. The story was related to him by one of the survivors of the original incident, who only wishes to be known as ‘Jason,’ and I shall do my best to relate it as it was described to me.

      Boggart was a quiet dwarf, the usual kind of man who’d take a contract, do his work, and go home. Men like these abound, you and I work with them every day, you know, man? I guess the man himself wasn’t exactly special, at least as far as I remember. Before that incident I rode in on the shuttle with him. Wouldn’t talk to no one, wouldn’t make eye contact. He looked worse off than most of us insofar as he looked like he was on the edge of shanking anyone. But apparently he was a much respected chef, the kind they issue gold stars to or something.

      Nanotrasen must’ve pissed away a lot of money on that contract, let me tell you. Worth every credit. He was quiet. Went to the commissary, did his work, no muss, no fuss. I’d interact with him only so much, when my work depended on it and at lunches and dinners. By the gods, the dwarf could cook, compliments to said chef. But outside of the food, the guy was a miserable cur, drove everyone away. Except for a friend of mine in janitorial named Sebastian. Vulpkanin, young fellow, sweet to everyone. Seb was always willing to clean the kitchen and run errands and Ashley took a shine to him. Weeks of meals and repairs, I had, and never saw that dwarf so much as smirk, and suddenly he was laughing. I didn’t think the dwarf was capable of it, but there it was. It seems so rare on stations like these, a delicate thing.

      But delicate things are taken away so very, very easily.

      ================================================
      Weeks went by and the two were two halves of one whole. And if the story ended there, it’d be a fairy tale. Unfortunately, it wasn’t. In places like these, they never are. Nanotrasen was working on a project, something dangerous, something only engineering, science, and the brass knew about, and of the grunts in engineering and science, maybe not even them. Even now, after everything happened, I can’t describe it. But near the end of our contract something happened. We didn’t know what they were working on, but someone else did.

      A crew attacked the station in force, half a dozen men, unkillable, to take this project. They tore through the station and the Captain, this human named [Halsten] Draco and Head of Security, a felinid whose name I don’t recall [Veronica Esperanza] threw everything they could to stop this seemingly unstoppable force. But they cut through security like a hot knife through butter.

      Apparently Ashley threw himself out into danger to try and find Seb and managed to find the poor vulpkanin cowering in a maintenance hallway near engineering as the kill crew moved forward under walking fire through engineering. He grabbed Sebastian and moved him to escape but as security was being cut down, the captain made an on-the-spot decision to seal engineering and leaving the ‘little people’ to their fates.

      They must’ve survived for a while by heading out through a maintenance shaft but from what I understood when engineering went critical, Sebastian was sucked into the vacuum. Ashley wasn’t. God, how different things would be had he gone with the kid because something in that dwarf broke. How do I know this? I was there, I saw everything. I sealed the door when Draco threatened to put me in with them if I didn’t. I watched as Ashley and Sabastian fled the oncoming fire, out of sight, and I thought they were gone, dead in a hail of lead. I was there when they retreated back to science, I sealed the door into it, I heard the banging in the vents but was too scared to say a word. What came after that I will never, ever forget.

      ================================================
      Burned to hell, missing a few fingers and bleeding profusely, Ashley emerged from the vents at the center of science and went ballistic. Security, the brass, they didn’t see the berserker coming from behind when they thought they were safe. He put a chef’s knife into a security officer’s eye, cleaved off another’s arm with a cleaver, and got the weapon stuck in the head of security’s skull. He went for the captain screaming revenge for the murder of Sebastian and by the grace of some unknown god that knife bounced off the captain’s chest, glancing, causing a deep but not lethal flesh wound. A necklace, a cross necklace big enough it caught the chef’s knife’s point and diverted it into his shoulder.

      The detective, suddenly promoted to head of security, managed to shoot Ashley back against some dangerous… thing… in the center of the room. A big crystalline structure, glowing gold, held in by delicate but I thought strong glass. Ashley reached up and grabbed a handle and the captain screamed something. I don’t recall clearly, something like it being dangerous, valuable, it was everything they were working for. I didn’t care. I was focused on the dwarf.

      “You’ve taken the only thing I ever loved,” I remember him growling as he dragged himself up off the ground. “And if it takes me a thousand lives, I’ll make sure the ones who sacrificed him and all the nobodies for their egos and vainglory suffer in this life and the next.”

      The detective shot, disoriented. The bullet went through a containment case. Arcs of lightning rushed out in all colors and before I could even think, the entire center of science vanished in a flash of light and silence, leaving behind nothing. When it passed, everything around whatever was in that case was gone. As was Ashley, and anything tied to him. We thought that was it and for some of us… it was.

      It wasn’t a month before the murders began, the bodies showing up slashed and mangled. Security, Nanotrasen representatives, internal affairs, scientists, and engineering, most. Draco left the station, promoted to a directorship elsewhere. It seems their work was a success after all. Now, “Ashy Slashy” prowls the halls, corridors, vents, and tunnels across the station in search of the man that murdered so many, wishing to sate his bloodlust and need for vengeance, but unlikely to ever find it. Not much is known about the haunting itself, save for that the specter appears incapable of harming anyone in custodial and those on the station are encouraged to wear religious iconography, even if they don’t believe.

      I doubt this will be the last we hear of “Ashy Slashy.” Not as long as more bodies keep appearing, or, should I say, what’s left of them…
