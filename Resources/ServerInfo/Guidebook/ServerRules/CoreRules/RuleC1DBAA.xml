  # Rule 1 - Don't be an Asshole

  These rules are not perfect. The rules attempt to clearly communicate what the admin team intends to be allowed and prohibited, but there are likely loopholes or other flaws that can be "lawyered". Don't attempt to manipulate the interpretation of the rules to suit your personal goals or to degrade the experience of other players.

  Everybody here's playing a game to have fun. Being an asshole in character is allowed, but extension of that outside of gameplay is strictly forbidden.

  This includes bigotry, any of which will get a quick ban. [bold]This is zero-tolerance.[/bold]

  This also includes self-antag or griefing or any other form of intentionally ruining others' fun for the sake of your own experience.

  Consistently toeing the line on these rules will be treated as rule violations and will get you banned.
