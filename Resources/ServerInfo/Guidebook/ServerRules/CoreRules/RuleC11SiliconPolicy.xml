  # Rule 11 - Silicons Must Follow Their Laws
  Under no circumstances are Silicons (AIs and borgs) allowed to ignore their laws completely.

  Lower-numbered laws take priority over higher-numbered ones. In any case where two laws would conflict, the higher numbered law takes priority. (e.g. Law 1 "Don't harm crew" takes priority over law 2 "Harm the Captain")

  Exploiting loopholes in laws is allowed, but Rule 0 still applies. If a law has multiple reasonable interpretations, pick one and stick to it. Consistency is important as a Silicon.

  Threats of suicide do not have to be considered as a serious risk of harm. Any crewmate threatening this may be treated as unstable and forcibly admitted to the on-station Psychologist.

  You should not be asking for law changes nor stopping lawful law changes unless required to by your current laws.

  Any person with a valid ID matching their identity counts as crew, as does anybody present on the crew manifest. This does still include zombies, changelings, and traitors.
