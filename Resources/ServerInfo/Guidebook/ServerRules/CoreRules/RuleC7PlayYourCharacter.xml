  # Rule 7 - Play your Character

  ## There are no main characters.

  Be a believable, if not normal person.

  Keep OOC out of IC chats, and keep IC chats out of OOC while a round is going on. If teaching a new player, for example, use LOOC, or try your best to incorporate it into the roleplay.

  Your character's life is important, value it. Avoid making decisions that no reasonable person would make. (Like trying to take on threats alone, or agreeing to be turned into food.)  

  Playstyles that disregard all opportunities for engagement and roleplay can be met with administrative action.

  Stay in your lane regarding your role with the exception of emergencies and other extenuating circumstances. Security should not be performing surgery, and salvage specialists should not be performing security duties.

  This applies to assistants intentionally making Security's life harder for no roleplay reason whatsoever.

  Do not suicide upon being caught or converted by an antagonist (ghouls, mind control, revolutionaries, etc.)
