  # Rule 13 
  # No End-Of-Round Griefing (EORG)
  
  EORG (End-of-Round-Grief) is not allowed. Players must act the same way they would before the Round End Summary screen pops up.

  Antagonists should not continue antagonistic actions once the evacuation shuttle arrives at CentComm.

  Round-ending threats such as Empowered Heretics, Blob, Zombies, Nuclear Operatives, and Dragons may still pursue their objectives after the round has ended.

  Evac Shuttle bombings are not allowed without first ahelping and receiving permission from an admin. If an admin does not respond, do not shuttlebomb.
