  # Internal Affairs Agent

  [bold]1.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents are only to prosecute in a court of law personnel facing a Capital Sentence. They should, however, ensure that Security is applying timed sentences correctly, and must alert Security if they are not. In addition, Internal Affairs Agents are permitted to provide legal advice for Security, as well as investigating whether or not arrests were done properly;

  [bold]2.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents must be granted permission from the presiding Judge (i.e. the Magistrate or Nanotrasen Representative) to serve as legal representation for personnel in any court hearing. Internal Affairs Agents may only serve as legal representation for personnel if another Internal Affairs Agent is capable of assuming the role of prosecution, and if no Lawyer is available. Internal Affairs Agents must also request permission from any potential client before serving as their legal representative, as said client may choose to either represent themselves, or request someone else;

  [bold]3.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents are not to deliberately halt or slow down prisoner processing or ongoing investigations. If Security is acting in a demonstrably incompetent manner, Agents should contact the Head of Security or Nanotrasen Representative. If more information about the crime in question is needed, Agents should wait until the person in question is brigged;

  [bold]5.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents are to ensure that Standard Operating Procedure is being properly followed, when applicable, and to contact the relevant Head of Staff when it is not;

  [bold]6.[/bold] Internal Affairs Agents are to attempt to resolve all Standard Operating Procedure issues locally before contacting the Nanotrasen Representative or, if the Representative is unavailable, Central Command. This should be done in tandem with Command staff and, if possible, personnel in the relevant Department. If a valid report is ignored by the relevant Head of Staff, the Nanotrasen Representative is to be contacted. If the Representative is unavailable or ignores the report, then the Captain should be contacted. If the Captain ignores the report, then Central Command must be contacted;

  [bold]4.[/bold] Lawyers are permitted to confidentially speak with their clients prior to any interrogation. Time spent conferring with a Lawyer may not be counted as time served during a timed sentence. If a client wishes to speak confidentially with their Lawyer during a timed sentence, the time remaining on their sentence must be frozen and may only resumed once the client has re-entered their cell. Lawyers may not divulge the contents of these confidential meetings without the explicit permission of their clients, except in cases where there are reasons to believe that their silence may endanger the lives and safety of other station personnel. If a Lawyer fails to divulge information that was found to later directly lead to the injury or death of personnel, the Lawyer should be charged as an accessory to the resulting crimes;
