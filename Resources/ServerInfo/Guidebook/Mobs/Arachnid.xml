  # Arachnids

  Arachnids are an eight-legged species of sentient giant spider.

  ## Arachnid Physiology

  Thanks to their additional arms and legs, Arachnids have two additional Pocket slots in their inventory.
  They suffocate 50% faster and recover from it 50% slower, and their Blue Blood can't be metabolised from Iron, being
  based on Copper instead.

  ## Diet

  Arachnids share evolutionary roots with spiders, and so they cannot metabolize Theobromine or Allicin. Be careful
  when eating chocolate, onions, or garlic, and avoid coffee and tea! Despite their dietary restrictions, they can eat
  raw meat without any ill effects.

  ## Pincers

  Arachnids' sharp legs and pincers cause them to deal [color=#ec3a3a]Piercing[/color] damage with their unarmed attacks.

  Arachnids can create Websilk at the cost of getting more hungry. They (and only they) can craft bundles of websilk
  into various items from clothing, shields, and medicine to entire walls and furniture.
